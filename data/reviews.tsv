Mary R.	5	Best go to Daily Lipstick ever	From the moment I tried it, I knew it was the perfect shade of pink, and it is amazing as a lip moisturizer.   In summary--LOVE IT!
Mary S.	5	Reading is life	I BELEIEVE WHOM EVER CAME UP WITH THESE COLORS FOR MATURE WOMEN IS A GENIUS. BOOKS FOR AFRICA IS A HEARTFELT BONUS MARY
Linda M.	5	Rich, creamy color!	Purchased the Strong Women trio. Love the smooth, rich feel. I put it on in the morning and it lasted me through the afternoon. The colors in this trio are not too bright, which I really like. Love the packaging!
Madonna f.	5	GREAT lipsticks!	From the selection, to the ease in ordering, to receiving the product in a timely manner, to the quality, to the color, to the packaging, to the non-profits that benefit from the sale.....these are GREAT lipsticks!  I am 62 years young and very picky about lipsticks as my lips have a tendency to dry out and I cannot wear anything with a smell. These lipsticks are creamy, no smell and beautiful colors. I highly recommend them.  I will be purchasing more colors for myself and also to give my friends at Christmas! Thanks for making such a stand-up product!   Madonna Van Fossen Auburn Hills, MI
Pammela J.	5	Wow! Wonderful üëÑ!	Wow! I was so pleased to get this lip color! This is really a magnificent color! I love the way it glides on and how rich it feels. I was pleasantly surprised by how well it stays on and how my lips felt moisturized the entire time. I am sure it‚Äôs due to the quality products used to make their lipsticks. I am totally pleased! Plan to buy more and share my newfound love for this company!
Rachel w.	5	Because I Love My Lips...	I purchased the ‚ÄúStrong Woman‚Äù pack of lipsticks recently, and the first thing that comes to mind is LOVE!   Amazing lipsticks, so soft and creamy! I am 51 years young and an in between girl when it comes to matte/cream/sheer/gloss, there is definitely a place for all in my lifestyle, but I have to say that the finish on these lipsticks is almost perfect for any occasion.  One can‚Äôt truly explain the color because they will look different on everyone, that being said I believe that the images on their beautiful website are very close to the product color.  I can tell you that I tend to have dry skin/lips, so as the lipstick wears my lips don‚Äôt feel dry or chapped, and there is a nice color pigment left on my lips as well, which I love.   The biggest plus for me all around is taste/smell, no nasty taste!!! I don‚Äôt have lip lines, but it does also stay put and looks lovely!   I also purchased the ‚ÄúMint to be‚Äù lip treatment- yep love that too!   Love that it‚Äôs for good causes and vegan. My only want is that maybe once in awhile we could create our own 3 pack! ü§ó *Wearing ‚ÄúIndependent‚Äù

Vivian V.	5	Terrific Lipstick	I am a "mature" woman, age 65, and was initially drawn to the ad for these lipsticks by that title. I just love the colors and ordered two. This was my favorite color, plus I am a dog lover and active in animal charities. The lipstick arrived and it is so smooth and comfortable and long lasting. Plus the color is gorgeous. I wear lipstick all the time as I live in Florida and am outside a great deal. This protects my lips marvelously and looks beautiful too. Plus I love the case!
Kathy P.	5	Can't say enough good things about brand Color The World!!!	I have been on the search for the perfect lipstick for years, and after finding this company my search is over! I am 64 and it doesn't feather, has great lasting power and feels so hydrating on the lips. The colors are true to the pictures. Made in the USA and it helps others, wow I am impressed!!! Thank you!!!

Robin S.	5	Love at first use!	I was initially attracted to this lipstick because of the cute tubes( shallow, I know)üòÇ! But once I used it I truly fell in love! It goes on so smooth. I have a scar that runs down my upper lip from a dog bite and this lipstick makes the scar almost invisible! The donations to different charities is a bonus.
Philisse B.	5	Excellent lipsticks	I hoped the lipsticks would be as promised but I was a little hesitant to purchase them. However, I have been so pleasantly surprised to find that the lipsticks do everything as promised. The colors are true, they go on so smoothly, they feel great, last a long time and do not feather into my senior lines around my lips. I will be ordering more - eventually I‚Äôd like to have all the colors. They are definitely worth the price. Thank you for creating them !!!

Debra B.	5	This is my first order	This is my first order and I got the trio. I love all three colors but Independent is my absolute favorite because the color goes with anything I wear. I've gotten lots of compliments & it feels so light and smooth. I'll be ordering more of this one!
Jill T.	5	My Go-To Lip Company	All their lipsticks are creamy! Great selection of colors & the best part is the length of time your lips have color. It's not a color stain, just a nice wearing lipstick. It's about all I wear anymore!
Anita C.	5	Exceptional product	As a new customer I wasn't sure what to expect but your lipsticks have numerous color choices and feel good on the lips...not dry. You color descriptions are accurate and groupings are very helpful when ordering online. I will definitely be ordering more and I like the ability to chose my own bundles. I hope you will introduce a lipliner in the near future.
Mayra Z.	5	Creamy lipsticks	I like the way they glide on and moisturizes my lips and that part of my purchase goes to charity. I will try other colors
Carol B.	5	Great product	Initially I was interested because it supported so many good causes, but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this product.

Janice G.	5	Absolutely the best lipstick!	This is the best lipstick I have bought. I am 69 years old and since I began wearing lipstick 55 years ago, I could not find one I liked. Flawless is not drying, stays for a very long time, doesn‚Äôt cause peeling, not greasy and looks pretty on my aging lips. It has added some needed moisture and doesn‚Äôt bleed. I‚Äôm so pleased I took another chance buying lipstick and didn‚Äôt need to add it to my collection of once-used. JMG
Karen D.	5	Very pretty color	I am blonde/blue with fair skin and this is a very pretty and natural color.

Caroline M.	5	Great colors best lipstick I	Great colors best lipstick I have ever bought for my 74 year old lips
Adina L.	5	"Mint To Be" Vegan Lip Gloss	This is one of the nicest Lip Glosses I ever bought. The mint smell is perfect and the texture is wonderful. Very creamy, goes on smoothly and moisturizer is very nice.
Jan L.	5	Soft colors	I tend to wear lip color that does not stand out since my makeup is minimal. These colors are very soft and suit my makeup scheme well. Do not expect bright from this trio, but understated muted color.
Suzanne M.	5	Cashmere " Protect The Kittens " Great Go To Color !!	I love this color. It is such a pretty neutral with a little color. It looks great a lone and as a top coat with additional colors I ordered. Make sure you utilize the suggestions for cool or warm skin tones to select the best colors for you ! We all know how difficult it can be to select the right color lipstick. You will love this color !! SMC
Theresa S.	5	Very creamy lip stick that	Very creamy lip stick that stays on longer than my others. I like this color because it is a lovely natural lip color.
Leilani S.	5	Love it!	Love the colors but most of all I no longer have to use any lip balm or chap stick to make my lips soft. No more dry chapped lips
Pamm W.	5	Love it!	I love this lipstick! Great colors, stays on, and doesn't feather. Haven't worn lipstick in ages because I just couldn't find a good one at a reasonable price. These are amazing and at an amazing price. AND it helps worthwhile causes-a bonus!!
Linda S.	5	Love this Lipstick!	I suffer from lung issues that often make my lips look a pale blue! Many have noticed this - until I purchased "Protect the Kittens" lip color. It is a complete JOY to look into the mirror and not be reminded of my health issues. I also appreciate that the lipstick isn't in a metal or plastic tube but rather a eco friendly biodegradable and adorable dispenser. This lipstick isn't just for those of us 50 and over, it also is beautiful on my 27 year old daughter. Thanks Color the World!!!!! Linda Red Wing, MN
Lisa V.	5	Wonderful!	Im so happy! Huntress was the color and a pcteefe t match for me!! The lipstick container is so cute!
Linda R.	5	Really is ‚Äúpretty n pink‚Äù	This is the most flattering lipstick - beautiful neutral pink that lights up your smile, but understated not bright. Goes on smooth and as advertised doesn‚Äôt bleed into lip lines.
Leah L.	5	Lip treatment stick	"Mint To Be" Lip treatment really helpful before Lip stick applied. Thank you.
Lisa O.	5	Best Lipstick Ever!	I don't usually write reviews, but the quality of this product deserves to be recognized. I finally found a lipstick that moisturizes, doesn't bleed into fine lines, and doesn't make my lips peel. Pretty N' Pink is a beautiful shade with a hint of shimmer - great for my pale complexion (natural red-head with blonde highlights, freckles, and blue eyes). Thank you for making this amazing product. You've gained a customer for life!
Kathleen B.	5	Surfberry is Beautiful!	I have just recently found this wonderful company and have purchased several lipsticks. They are all wonderful, go on very smoothly, and make my lips feel very good. However, I think Surfberry is my favorite color. It really brightens up my face, and a little on my cheeks gives me a nice over all glow.
Janice A.	5	Huntress	Color is lighter than it looks. Just the right tint for me
ClassyLibrarian	5	So Good!!	Love this color! Does need to be touched up after eating but pretty much all lipsticks that are moisturizing do. No bleeding, settling into lines or patchiness. Will purchase more colors!!
Barbara S.	5	Great Lipstick, Great Cause	Being an animal lover and wanting to try a chemical-free lipstick while supporting a wonderful cause, I didn‚Äôt hesitate to buy this one. The color is perfect on me, & the lipstick glides right on without giving me the appearance of ‚Äúold lady lips‚Äù. I also love the kitty design on the tube. I am pleased with my purchase & will definitely try another color.
Lindalee1952	5	Beautiful!!	This is a great lipstick! Goes on velvety smooth and lasts for hours!
Diane P.	5	Lovely colors for mature women.	Lovely colors for mature women.
Marlene C.	5	Empowered was new to me	I wanted Flawless and Independent to replace the ones I‚Äôve used up. I love those colors. When I saw the trio that included Empowered I decided to give it a try. I love it just as much as the others. It‚Äôs a great daytime casual with the same staying power (minus the drying look of matte lip colors). These are my favorite lipsticks because I find the formulas absolutely perfect! The names of the shades are perfect too!
Renee A.	5	I love the title‚Äîit captures our souls and makes us want to make a difference.	I just lost a lovely friend who created a Christian Ministry- Water Mission- a global effort to bring safe drinking water to thousands of children and adults all over the world. She died tragically but her legacy will live on. I dedicate Surfberry to her memory.

Sonia L.	5	Outstanding	It covers in one swipe. It doesn't bleed. It feels so smooth and creamy. It has no taste. It has just the right feel and look of matte. I usually buy Clinique but since this is for a cause I am willing to switch. I Love it.
June B.	5	No bleeding!	This lipstick does not bleed into fine lines! It actually stands up to all the claims it makes. Moisturizing, long lasting.
Barbara S.	5	Best Lip Balm	Yay! I have finally found a lip balm that doesn‚Äôt dry out my lips, isn‚Äôt shiny & has just the right amount of mint flavor. Thank you for making a lip balm that actually does what it‚Äôs supposed to do.

Brenda W.	5	Wow!!	I received my three lipsticks and was a bit skeptical at first, then I used them! I love how silky they feel, no bleeding out and over my lipliner and good coverage. The one thing I can say is the colors are not as dark as advertised but are still fantastic!!
Maureen C.	5	It does just what it promises	As a woman of ‚Äúof a certain age,‚Äù 67 to be exact, finding the right lipstick is a challenge. I got this set because I wanted to try different shades. It definitely doesn‚Äôt bleed. Women my age know what a gift that is. I think I know what shades work for me, so I can try some others. The ingredients are excellent and feel great on dried lips. Great product.

Helen R.	5	Exceeded my expectations	Color the World caught my attention because they are socially conscious and the lipsticks are cruelty free, not to mention formulated for older women.

Wendy T.	5	Amazing	Love love love this! I have a tube of this Mint to be in my purse and also next to where I sit at home so that I can put it on whenever my mouth and lips get dry. I live in Phoenix AZ and right now it's over 105-112 degrees every day. I love the feel and texture of this on my mouth. I think that it is helping reduce the fine lines around my lips and mouth as well.

Sarah W.	5	blendable and buildable	very good everyday lipstick set. easy to apply, and feels good.
Ivy G.	5	A beautiful pale pink, really	A beautiful pale pink, really doesn't feather.
Linda H.	5	love bundle	Love the colors. Very true to the advertisement. All three colors were great for me depending on what I was wearing, my mood, the event, and the time of day. Also, the lipstick was a great moisturizer. I definitely rate the "Color the World" collection a 5! Thanks Linda
Adina L.	5	Empowered	The colors in this Pack are gorgeous ! ! and the lipstick is creamy and goes on beautifully:)  I love these lipsticks and I will recommend them to my friends!
Elizabeth B.	5	My new favorite!	Color is just what I was looking for, very pleased with the product.
Jan K.	5	Fabulous	Love my new Strong Woman pack. The colors are perfect and the lipstick is so smooth. Feels great.
Jennie W.	5	Love it!	I‚Äôll be truthful. I used to rescue and transport dogs so I chose this color because of donating back to a rescue. But guess what? I love the color and feel on my lips.
Elyse L.	5	Very flattering lip color for	Very flattering lip color for a fair skinned person like myself. Creamy and long lasting
Elizabeth H.	5	Love the colors	I am an older woman and it seemed very color I chose didn't look right on me....instead of adding color to my complexion they seemed to wash me out. I looked so pale. The 'give a dog a home' is the perfect shade of pink.' Homes for our troops' is the perfect nude. Each one lipstick seems to help brighten my face and I no longer look sick, instead I have some life. I found both of these shades to be just enough color for my age. I don't look like a clown school escapee, like some of the other bands I had tried.
Claudette G.	5	It does leave me Speechless.	This is my favorite color. It goes on smooth and lasts very long. Thank you Color the World for the many wonderful colors and all vegan.
Allison G.	5	Wow, just wow!	I absolutely love this lipstick! It‚Äôs creamy, colors are beautiful, it looks natural yet vibrant, and it has staying power. My 17 year old daughter also loves it- we will be ordering more colors. Not to mention, great causes to support.
Kathy T.	5	Wonderful lipstick!	I selected Wildflower-much lighter than I expected but still nice color and doesn't feather or make my lips peel! I will order a darker color next time-I just know I will have a collection of these lovely lipsticks before too long!!!
Danette E.	5	Will always buy this lipstick from now on	I was very skeptical at first. It's always been hard for me to get the perfect color and picking from a website? Well I was so wrong. Not only were all three colors perfect for me the quality of the lipstick rivals the big name cosmetics. It doesn't bleed. It's creamy without feeling heavy on your lips and it doesn't have a perfume smell. I have found my forever lipstick.....finally!
Dalia K.	5	Beautiful color	Feels and looks great. Love the fact that‚Äôs it‚Äôs all natural and also donates to such great causes. Will buy again.
Alana Q.	5	My new order	Love the colors and so glad these lipsticks are not filled with chemicals. I would like to know if they can be kept refrigerated in between usage. It‚Äôs been so hot all over the country and it would be wonderful to be able to do that. I am sure other women would also want to know. Thanks!
Ellen P.	5	Pretty Pink	Too light for me, but I gave it to a friend and she loves it!
Joy L.	5	Fantastic feel, check your temperature!	I love this lipstick. It feels amazing, doesn't bleed, and wears very well for a 'normal' lipstick that doesn't try to be 24-hour and dry me out!  The color is a little too warm for my skin, and I gave it to a friend. (She is SO happy!) I thought I was borderline warm/cool, but it turns out I'm entirely cool. Even the neutrals (I tried three) can run a bit warm on me. This is not a particularly warm color, though--if you're truly a neutral, this would probably work for you. And it's a lovely shade.  If you think you're in the middle, temperature-wise, know that these colors run a wee bit warm, compared to some big-name brands.
Brenda A.	5	Subtle	I love this shade because it is subtle. I am passionate about rescue dogs and am glad this helps them!
Phyllis B.	5	Cheerful	This lipstick is smooth and long lasting and the color is so fun and cheery. Biodegradable package is light weight for travel.
Linda H.	5	Huntress- Give a dog a forever home.	Love the color!!! Best lipstick, smooth and creamy. This color has a special place in my heart because our dog is a rescue and he's the best and so is the lipstick!!!
Helen P.	5	Great Lipstick	Love the consistency and feel of this brand of lipstick. The Surfberry is a great color, vibrant and youthful.
Eva C.	5	I love this one, like	I love this one, like all the others that I have tried, 5 shades in all. They feel good on my lips. I don't have to worry about animal products on my lips. It never bleeds into the lines around my mouth, which for a 70 year old woman is remarkable. And the shades are all suited for my complexion.
Anita A.	5	Love It & Cause Behind It.	This is such a different lip stick. Goes on very smoothly and lasts quite a while without retouching it. It stays on week and it doesn‚Äôt feather as advertised. I love the color. It‚Äôs a soft pink that‚Äôs subtle. I can‚Äôt wait to try other colors. Plus, I love contributing to good and worthy causes.
Victoria B.	5	Beautiful lipstick	Really nice color, I highly recommend!
Gina F.	5	Best Ever!	I was doubtful upon ordering these rather expensive lipsticks. I found out they were worth the extra price! In addition to being fairly long-lasting, they are ODOR FREE!!!!
Cheryl K.	5	Excellent product!	When I saw the Facebook ad for Color The World lipstick, I will admit I was skeptical about the claims saying how good these lipsticks are. I ordered three colors, one of which was Warrior, and I could not be more pleased! The lipsticks are smooth, creamy, do not wear off easily, and the selection of colors is great. Warrior is a lovely neutral color that I believe would look nice on anyone, no matter what their skin tone or age is. So glad I tried it!
Inieren P.	5	Best lipstick ever	I love it so much
Heather J.	5	Beautiful color!	Love this lipstick! It's brighter than it looks in the tube. Once I've put on a good application the color will stay for hours, almost like a stain. I'll definitely be trying other colors!.
Judith S.	5	I love my Irresistible lipstick.	I love my Irresistible lipstick. Very moist. Long lasting color. Will definitely purchase more.
Sheila G.	5	Pretty N'Pink	Beautiful color with my silver hair! Very creamy and feels good on. Just enough shine. Will be ordering more.
Kerry L.	5	Love these lipsticks!	I have bought 7 of these now, they are great. I am going to be 62 this year and other lipsticks were starting to run. These do not, and the colors are so pretty.
Lisa O.	5	Very pretty shade	Very pretty shade,It goes on so smooth and gentle the colors are wonderful I recommend this to all women young and old and thank you for giving back to our communities in our country
Louise C.	5	Excellent	It really does do what it claims! As a 60 year old woman, bleeding of lipstick doesn‚Äôt help a person with anxiety feel better about themselves. I LOVE this product and will definitely buy it again! Thank you üëÑ
Karin N.	5	Just like me--only better!	I didn't think it would really be different, but something about it does stay put and not feather. As the title says--I look in the mirror and see me--only better!
Sandra W.	5	Gorgeous color for this natural redhead!	I absolutely love The Sunset shade of lipstick! I'm a natural redhead with fair skin and have occasional redness in my compextion. Sunset looks fantastic with almost all of my clothing. It acts as a neutral for me, with just the right amount of brightness and pop. Feels amazing on my lips. Love the packaging!
Lillian R.	5	Great, lasting color!	Goddess is a good, dark color without too much red. It's pretty, feels good & lasts. I also like that I'm helping our world community.
Ania B.	5	Truly am Heartfelt for this one!	This is the perfect shade of red for me! Love how it makes my lips feel soft and the color goes on well without making the lines stand out. Stays on for a good couple of hours and only have to touch up once (during a six hour workday).
Janet L.	5	Beautiful	Love all the colors. Stays in place. No funky taste!‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
Christina H.	5	Chris	I'm 70 years old and have not been happy with other lipsticks. This is smooth, stays on and is very moist. I love the ingredients and the mission. This lipstick is flattering, even at my age!
Sharon C.	5	FanTASTIC!!	Just purchased MORE of the wonderful lipsticks in other colors I knew I would love! Am exceedingly happy with my purchases. The lipstick is exactly as advertised and what I really like is how he colors are not glaring like the younger crowd wears. The colors are still bright or muted, depending on which you choose, but they all have a softness with no matte, which can make you look older. Love the quality and packaging too......a cardboard casing, not more plastic to add to the environment. Thanks for that!!
Nadia M.	5	Beautiful!	I ordered 3 lipsticks and honestly I‚Äôve been wearing them everyday ! Color goes on evenly, doesn‚Äôt crack or dry out lips. I‚Äôm very pleased with this product . I will order again. Thanks for a nice product!
Sandra K.	5	First-time purchase	This is my first purchase and I will definitely be buying mire. The colors are great and they last a long time. I am happy to help others too!
Mary A.	5	You can't go wrong with 24K!	24K is a beautiful color and it goes on as smooth as butter! Plus I love its staying power, it will definitely be one I choose frequently.
Marcia M.	5	Good quality	The lipstick is very smooth and the color is beautiful!
Marie C.	5	Flattering color	This color looks good on tanned skin, olive skin tone....I think even fair skin...i ran out so i ordered another..i use it often especially in summer
Marie B.	5	Loveee it!!	Pretty N' Pink is an awesome color for those of us who look best in cool tones...it has a slight shimmer but looks rather natural with a little sparkle...would definitely buy again when this runs out or as a gift...
Valerie S.	5	Great Treatment	I love this peppermint scented nurturing lip treatment. Wear it under lipstick or alone at night. LOVE
Deborah O.	5	Best Lipstick Ever	Absolutely the best lipstick ever. Just as the product states....no more bleeds from oily lipstick. Try it you‚Äôll be glad you did.
A R.	5	Great lip balm	Was addicted to another brand for years, so it took me a few days to kind of withdraw using this lip balm. Now I don‚Äôt get up and have to use it right away in the a.m. I still probably use it too much, but I just love it so I use it a lot. Like it so much, I bought two more tubes. Pricey but worth every penny.
Donna P.	5	Love!	Very light coverage that softens lips. I love putting it on under my lipstick.
Dixie R.	5	Creamy goodness	I love this product, I have searched for years for a lipstick I like.... These are great! Creamy but don't feel slimy and the colors are wonderful! All this and I love that my purchase helps others too. üíì. I will definitely keep buying these lipsticks üòÄ
Anne S.	5	Beautiful colors	I took my new lipsticks to Africa on safari and they held up beautifully. They did not get soft and the soft colors were great.
Tina M.	5	Love the lipstick does not	Love the lipstick does not bleed into my aging lines.
Shelby S.	5	Love your lipsticks ! My	Love your lipsticks ! My daughter and I want to save the puppies.
Elizabeth H.	5	Nice colors, decent non-toxic ingredients	There were 3 nice matte colors. The colors were quite similar when you apply them to different parts of your lips, but they all seemed to work with my pale pinkish skin. The ingredients were non-toxic and none of them chapped my lips. The only suggestion that I would have would be to add a little gloss to the color, but I fixed that by adding a light gloss coat over the top.
Elizabeth M.	5	Just the right color	I love both the color of this lipstick and the ease it applies.  I don‚Äôt like colors that make your lips scream look at me. I like a color that compliments my face and hair. This lipstick does just that and goes on moist and is good for my lips.
Karen M.	5	Coral Reef lip color	Love it! Holds in moisture on lips and no feathering. Nice soft color. Will order more.
Linda D.	5	Love It!	I was delighted to see and read the advertisement for this lipstick for mature women, although I believe that anyone would be thrilled to add any of the original colors to their collection. I love the Rose Gold lipstick. In addition to the collection. I ordered the lip treatment which felt really good. The containers are very decorative and environmentally friendly. The caps of the lipstick is a heavyweight rolled cardboard which is not waterproof . I wish iit were so that I could leave it on my bathroom vanity with my other lipsticks.  I am awaiting a second delivery of a new collection. It‚Äôs a good feeling to know that I am making a small difference as a portion of the purchase of each individual lipstick goes to a specific charity. Every woman loved a new lipstick üíÑ!  If I had a negative comment‚Äîit‚Äôs a customer service issue . I like to ask questions and spots a live representative prior to purchase. I am a redhead, fair complexion with amber eyes. I found it frustrating to communicate by email which often took two days to receive a brief note. I am still awaiting a response from a supervisor from my last query/concern regarding my newest order. I guess that the company is rather new and it may take a while for management to work out the glitches . I will be happy to write another review when I receive my second order. Hopefully , a customer profile is maintained to avoid duplication of frequent orders.  These folks have a nice product while giving back to worthwhile causes‚Äîa winning combination!  Linda W-D, Dallas, Texas
Cheryl S.	5	Best lipstick ever	They don‚Äôt bleed. No more weird lines of lipstick shooting up from my top lip

I would order from this company again .... thanks!

Deborah L.	5	Amazing Products	I believe I have 7 different shades of this lipstick and, while a couple of them aren‚Äôt great on me, the formula is so amazing, I wear them around the house. The product makes my lips feel amazing! The colors that do work well for me are awesome and they are long lasting!!! ‚ÄúMagnificent‚Äù is my absolute favorite!
Rhonda F.	5	Beautiful color and my lips	Beautiful color and my lips feel silky. It doesn't look cracked and dried up after a few hours. I have 5 colors and love them all
Marlene W.	5	Love the lipstick, it's exactly	Love the lipstick, it's exactly as advertised and color is so very true and pleasant. In fact, if I could afford I should have at least 3 as I try to carry in my purse but then need it in my make up area and another because I can't find the first.
Tracy C.	5	I just wanted to say	I just wanted to say Thank You for such an AMAZING product. I purchased Huntress, Kisses and Pretty in Pink. These lipsticks are Phenomenal!!!

Not only do you get a pretty package, but you get excellent ingredients and it really works...it doesn‚Äôt bleed into wrinkles around your mouth! I‚Äôve been looking for a lipstick like this with no avail...until now. Part of the proceeds goes to a charity. Fabulous invention and marketing!
Donna M.	5	Love this chap stick	When I ordered some lipstick I saw this chap stick and thought I'd give a try, so glad I did. I love the mint flavor and it makes your lips feel very hydrated. Will definitely order this again.
Dawn G.	5	Adds moisture	I use this alone and also on top of the lipstick. I would purchase again.
Mary G.	5	I ordered Empowered and LOVE	I ordered Empowered and LOVE it. I usually don't order lipstick color over the internet (I'm picky about the color), but this one was perfect. First I put on Mint to Be and then the Empowered. I will order it again!
Patricia C.	5	Lovely Empowered Neutral	Empowered's hue provides me with a a subtle, step up from natural look that I like. Leaves me feeling a bit more polished when I wear it to work, knowing it will stay put on my lips. A bit of the Pretty N' Pink on top of it in the middle of my lower lip makes a nice highlight when I want to change it up without changing the entire color. Empowered to enjoy looking good!
Lisa B.	5	First time customer	Love the color. Just wished it stayed on a bit longer.
Carolyn C.	5	best lipstick ever	it feels great on my lips. When I first put it on I was concerned about the color. However, after a minute or two the color "bloomed" into a light warm rose shade that looks appropriate for my age, pale complexion and white hair. I will definitely buy it again and recommend this brand to others.
Sharon P.	5	Pleased	I thought the color would be deeper but it's for a good cause and so l'm pleased.
Marcia M.	5	Nice color	Smooth and cute !
GINNY	5	24K Awesome	This is a second purchase within a month in a different color Love the color, goes on smoothly and looks nice when layering over another color.

I purchased the Fairytale Love Bundle and these colors are the BOMB DIGGITY! Everything about this lipstick bundle ROCKS!

Nan H.	5	Perfect in every way.	I have been looking for a My Lips But Better lipstick for about 25 years. I have finally found it in the shade Huntress. It glides beautifully on my lips, stays put for a long time, doesn‚Äôt bleed and the best thing is it does not pill up on my lips. This is a problem I have had with all other lip products I have purchased. After applying a lipstick or gloss with in just a few minutes it starts to dry and pill up so bad that I have to remove it. This doesn‚Äôt happen with my Color The World lipstick. I have worn it every day since it arrived. My 65 year old lips are thrilled!

Therese M.	5	Not heavy or sticky feeling	the lipstick feels nice .. not the heavy sticky feeling but a natural moisturizing feel
Bonnie N.	5	Love It!	Love these lipsticks. They are the perfect texture. Most others are too gooey or too dry. They either go outside the lip lines or flake off.

Becky M.	5	Perfect!	Love the color and especially the fact that it does stay a LOT longer than any other lipstick I've ever tried. It doesn't feather, and it makes my lips look really smooth. I like too that the company helps the environment by using heavy cardboard tubes instead of plastic for the lipstick, and that a portion of the price you pay is donated to the charity that each tube is associated with.
Lynn P.	5	Irresistible	This is a beautiful color. It looks great on and is in a pretty case.
Barbara S.	5	Great lipstick!	I have finally found the best lipstick for me! I have searched for years for a creamy beautiful color that will stay on and not bleed. I found it in 'Color The World'.

Sandra W.	5	Another gorgeous color for this natural redhead!	Rose is a very pretty lipstick! I was worried it might be too pink for me (natural redhead, fair skin, some facial redness), but after trying it on with some outfits, I was blown away. While it definitely has a very slight pink tone, it has some peach in there and acts as a great neutral for me and adds pop to my face!

They fade beautifully and the color lasts. Thank you for making this product. I plan on purchasing many more.
Debra I.	5	It is marvelous!	Smooth and really doesn't bleed! Shimmery young look.
Gwen F.	5	Great color!!!	It‚Äôs a bit more salmon than I anticipated but it looks marvelous!!!

I‚Äôve just started wearing makeup again after about a 20 year break.. so glad I‚Äôm starting with these wonderful lipsticks!!!!
Maryjane L.	5	Pretty summer shade.	Bright and happy color, perfect for summer days. And this lipstick is awesome, stays on and looking greasy, even on my time worn lips!
Pamela S.	5	Glamberry lipstick	I was skeptical at first. I decided to try it but I didn‚Äôt expect it to be as good as the advertisement. I thought it would be like a lot of lipsticks I‚Äôve recently purchased . I was wrong! I love Glamberry lipstick. It brightens my face and doesn‚Äôt overpower my light complexion . It doesn‚Äôt bleed or feather in my lines. It stays on a long time and it feels nice when I‚Äôm wearing it. I will make future purchases.
Marilyn S.	5	Beautiful Neutral	Empowered is a lovely color that works well as a neutral. It is creamier than high end and more expensive lipsticks. I do like my lips to pop a bit so next purchase will be a brighter one. I appreciate the color details and swatches but I still have a hard time choosing!
Nanette H.	5	Very nice	Very nice

Linda S.	5	Brilliant Idea for a Wonderful New Product!	First, I was totally amazed at the packaging of this product. I am a lipstick nut. Had to try this lipstick because of all the great things going for it. 1. Packaging, 2. All the beautiful colors that the lipstick comes in, 3. Great creamy and moist feel and it doesn‚Äôt bleed, 4. The PRICE! I only bought a few my first order because I had to see if the lipstick met my standards. It is so creamy and feels so soft on my lips, not sticky or dry. I can‚Äôt wait to order more. I only wish the colors were a little deeper. Their staying power is not very long. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone.

Pamela E.	5	So glad to help kittens or any animal for that matter.	My new lipstick is exactly what I have been looking for. I'm 72 and have not worn lipstick for many years because it seemed to draw attention to the lines around my mouth. This lipstick is different. It doesn't feather into the lines and this color is perfect.

Conniem M.	5	Strong Women Pack - Beautiful Lips	As someone who cannot tolerate most lipsticks due to a dye irritation/allergy, I am so excited to have found this lipstick. The colors are just perfect and feel smooth and moist for the duration. It stays on longer than traditional beauty counter or drugstore lipstick without the permanent dyes that burn and peel my lips.   The color isn‚Äôt so bold that it gives the appearance of ‚Äútoo much‚Äù, Color The World is subtle but very noticeable. Isn‚Äôt that what make up should really be about? Accentuating our natural beauty as women! I am a customer for life, have introduced my DIL and Daughter to it and we all can‚Äôt sing their praises enough. It took me 40 years but I finally found a lipstick that I‚Äôve been looking for my entire life. Hand poured and vegan, can‚Äôt think of a more quality production process. Thank you, CTW!

Charlotte S.	5	Better than I expected	I purchased "Flawless", it is a beautiful shade of pink, its not bright but like a shade or two darker than Blush Pink. You ladies that have a doubt should just go ahead a get a tube but you won't be disappointed! It is creamy, moisterizing & well, flawless. Its everything you want & expect in lipstick. It just glides on your lips. It is more than I normally spend on lipstick but good grief, check out the causes you are supporting! That lessens the blow of "paying that much". Give it a try, you won't be sorry.
Cindy N.	5	Love it!	This lipstick is so smooth, doesn't feather and stays on longer than any other lipstick I own. The color is so pretty! I would highly recommend this lipstick.
Shareen S.	5	Love	This is the best feeling lipstick, so creamy. It last longer than most I have used. Love all the colors and that they help a cause. Thank you for a wonderful product.

Stephanie G.	5	Neutral trio	I turned 45 this year, I honestly never wore much make up and hardly ever lipstick but this year I thought I needed a little more glam and maintenance so I bought the neutral trio. I absolutely loved them all! the lipsticks really stay on, the colors are beautiful and perfect if you want to get accustom to wearing lipstick without too much. Many of my friends asked me for the brand and the cute package is a bonus! Highly recommend!
Carole W.	5	Beautiful shade	This shade of pink is very flattering and it really doesn't feather into the creases of your lips. I love the creamy feeling as well.
Elizabeth L.	5	High quality, great colours	Love, love, love the Strong Woman Pack. The colours are rich and beautiful and the texture is amazing. Customer for life!
Beth R.	5	It's a sister thing	Live Foxy, got one for each of my sisters and one for myself! Glides on smooth and stays Foxy!
Roberta B.	5	Love it!	Love it!
Patricia K.	5	Happily satisfied.	I always worry about lipstick as some tend to be drying. The two I purchased are just terrific. I am thrilled with the packaging too.  Patricia
Patricia C.	5	Pretty as a Pink-ture	Pleased with my first purchase of Pretty N' Pink. The lipstick stays put on my lips, and this shade lends itself well to highlight the other shade I purchased. Two lipsticks, three looks! I'll be back for more.
Mary V.	5	Color The World Lipsticks	I am extremely pleased with my purchase of Color The World Lipsticks. They go on smooth and the color lasts a long time. They keep my lips moist but not gummy. I would buy this lipstick again.
Grace M.	5	Feels great	I love my "bundle" of three complementary lipsticks. Each one is a great color and they feel great on my lips, staying on as well. I'm glad they're not too shiny. Could never find the right shades online, but this time, I did! Definitely buying more.
Niko V.	5	Nice product	I really like the products Color the World is offering.
Terry L.	5	Glamberry Berry is as advertised	New customer and I just love the color. Best lipstick that goes on very smoothly. There is no feathering. Great product. I will definitely be back.
Mary C.	5	So creamy does not bleed.	So creamy does not bleed. I am 68 years old and lips are wrinkled. So happy to find a lipstick that I can wear and looks very natural.
Maryanne M.	5	Love them all	Love them all
Susan M.	5	I'm hooked!	My fancy department store lipstick has met its match. Not only is my new Rose Petal lipstick made with natural ingredients it , surprisingly, is more long wearing than I anticipated and my lips actually feel better. Goodbye fancy lipstick! I'm moving on. Color the World is my new brand.
Isabel G.	5	Heartfelt	Absolutely love this color! My first time ordering and I find the lipsticks very moisturizing and color lasts pretty long, with minimal fading.
Judy O.	5	Great lipsticks	Fastest delivery ever. These lipsticks do not feather. I'm 70 so I don't need anything extra around my mouth! The colors are lovely, subtle and very flattering
Judy H.	5	Smooth	Didn‚Äôt cake, didn‚Äôt bleed. Left my lips feeling smooth and hydrated, and left a nice natural tint throughout my day.
Patti C.	5	Love these products!	I bought three and love all of them, the only problem is choosing which color to wear each day
Glo D.	5	Very nice	Good color stays put. Just enough shine as well. I ordered more.
Deborah C.	5	Wildflower	Subtle, understated, yet perfect for me in color, creaminess and feel. Long-lasting and stays in place wonderfully. Thank you - I'll be back!
Kimberley B.	5	New me, Brain cancer free.	I chose this one because after my tumor was removed I was full of deptession, and anxiety both. I was then a Thirty year old bald lady. GREAT !
M	5	Love!	I tried these on with no other makeup. They all look and feel awesome! Southern Red is going to be my new everyday color. I generally just wear tinted bb cream, mascara, and maybe a bit of blush. I have light/medium olive skin. I need lipstick to balance my dark features , but like a natural look. Glamberry is a beautiful classic red, similar to MAC‚Äôs Ruby Woo or Revlon‚Äôs Cherries in the Snow. GNO is a bit more mauve. I think it will be my winter everyday favorite.
Laurie R.	5	Exceeded My Expectations	I had no idea what to expect, but decided to give this lipstick a try. Glad I did. I love the texture on my lips. It's creamy but not slippery/greasy. And I find when I eat, I still have color on my lips, which is unheard of with today's lipsticks, unless they go on like a tattoo, which leaves my lips very dry. I love the colors, and I'm particularly fond of the lipstick tubes. I can actually find them in my purse because of the bright colors and pretty designs. I intend to purchase more as I'd like to try out a few different shades. My favorite thus far: Flawless!
Ruth H.	5	Eating crow	This lip stick is the bomb! I am 65 yrs. old and this lip stick does not run and is highly hydrating. I‚Äôve got 5 tubes of this now and will buy more I‚Äôm sure. Can‚Äôt say enough good about Color the World! When I first bought my 1st 3 tubes, didn‚Äôt like the color BUT now it‚Äôs the best i‚Äôve Ever used. Buy it, you won‚Äôt be sorry! I am ‚ÄúTickled Pink‚Äù in more ways than one!
Joan G.	5	Very moisturizing	Very moisturizing and the color is beautiful. The only downside is the lipstick doesn‚Äôt last through eating so you need to reapply.
Gail M.	5	Love it	Tthis is undoubtedly the best lipstick I have found. Mainly because the color stays on for so long. Others arre gone within an hour. I also liike the matt finish instead of gloss.
Tom Z.	5	Empowered	Loved it!
Elaine G.	5	Rich color!	The red is the perfect color by itself. I like to use 2 shades to make my own shade. With Magnificent & Speechless you really are. Perfect.
Carole V.	5	LIKE	Color is perfect for my skin tone
Diane K.	5	Great Product!	After reading reviews, the decision was made to experience these lipsticks for myself. Even though I am a positive person, I do harbor skepticism at times. This lipstick was everything and more! The color was a flattering shade for me; there was no bleeding; it was long lasting and the feel is very comfortable. Look at me...now you have me writing one of those reviews!!
Becky M.	5	Love it!	Best lipstick I‚Äôve ever used!
Hikaru Y.	5	Nice	Love this lipstick and cover  Color is so good  No smell, texture is good, good cause, will buy for sure
Patricia C.	5	Love it!!	I bought the Strong Women pack and I had to get a second Empowered. I wear colors in the cool family. This one is perfect for every day when I want my lips to have some color and feel good. Now I have one for home and one in my purse. Independent is my second choice, it has a more color. I have found my new "go to" place for lipstick!
Charlene M.	5	Lipstick	I wore a namebrand lipstick for years. After learning I was taking in a lot of chemicals just from my lipstick, I quit buying it. Lipstick tends to do funny things on me, so I had a difficult time trying to find a replacement color wise that I liked. I happened to find Color the World lipstick by accident. I felt it was worth a try & I‚Äôve been more then pleased. It has nice texture, healthy & I‚Äôm happy with the color. It doesn‚Äôt change on me. Thank you!
Gay K.	5	Great purchase	I love the lipstick and it was a great purchase. I really like that you also donate some of the profits to awesome causes. This lipstick was received really quickly.
Nancy L.	5	Wonderful product!	What wonderful products! I purchased Empowered and Huntress. Both shades were exactly what I was looking for. The lipstick goes on smoothly, feels soothing on my lips, and really lasts. Shipping was quick and, since this is a hot Carolina summer, I really appreciated the note on the packing slip to let the lipstick sit for 4 hours before trying on. Great products combined with social responsibility...couldn't ask for more.
Patricia W.	5	Puppy Kisses for this lipstick	This lipstick is wonderful. It makes my lips feel so soft. And it doesn‚Äôt bleed into my wrinkles. I was a little disappointed because it wasn‚Äôt more coral. This just gives me a good reason to buy another tube. I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm helping dogs have a forever home.
Patricia R.	5	Jazzy Lip Colors	Empowered is another beautiful lipcolor that compliments my wardrobe on the job and off the job. Thank you!!!
Denise H.	5	Waiting for fall	I bought this set for fall but of course, tried them all right away! They are all so pretty. As expected, they don‚Äôt look as dark when you put them on. Always smooth, always odorless, always make your lips feel good. I really feel good buying from this company.
Louise D.	5	I like the lipsticks very	I like the lipsticks very much. I purchased them because they were advertised not to feather and that holds true.

Cheryl D.	5	Love this color and all	Love this color and all my purchases from Color my Worldüòä
Deborah C.	5	This shade is perfection	I love these new lipsticks! The colors are great for us mature ladies. I loved the pinks when I was young, but they don't compare with what I need these days.
Janice N.	5	pretty N' Pink	Beautiful color, I'm over 65 and it's not too dark or too light
Sheryl L.	5	Irresistible - "Books for Africa"	Irresistible is the second lip color I have ordered from Color the World Lipsticks - the first one was Cashmere. Having used the very muted Cashmere for a while, I was happy to try a more dynamic color in order to effect a different mood or look. I am quite happy with both the tone and the feel of Irresistible, adding color in a way that stays put and still feels natural. I will continue to try new colors.
Lois M.	5	Pretty N‚Äô Pink	This is a very nice lipstick, for the price. The color is just want I want and the texture is really good. I will be ordering more.
Pamela B.	5	Great lipstick. Won‚Äôt crack on lips	Love this natural lipstick. No more cracking of my lips as with other commercial lipsticks. This is the first one I have found that doesn‚Äôt crack my lips. Gilded on so smoothly. Great color
Maxine F.	5	I love the three colors.	I love the three colors. I gave "Huntress" to my daughter. I wore Southern Red to church which went very well with my outfit. I do wear make up which helps me from looking all washed out. Thank you very much.
Linda S.	5	My world is colored	I love my new lipstick the colors are great, but what I like most is the moisture the lipstick gives my lips. They never feel dry.
Patricia r.	5	Love my lipsticks	Love these lipsticks. The tubes are adorable and make it easy for my 65 yr old eyes to spot the tube I am looking for with different patterns for each color. No more squinting to try and read a tiny name or # on the end of the tube. Live the creamy silky feel and the colors were great. And to help out various charities is an added plus.
Sydney H.	5	Love it!!	I have tried many different lipsticks and love how well this one goes on and got so many compliments!
Marie B.	5	Perfect	They nailed it on the advice for choosing colors. Bought two different colors and the both look good.
Joan M.	5	color the world lipstick	I love the color and really am impressed that it does not bleed.
Kate H.	5	Great color.	Great color.
Michelle R.	5	Not to red or overbearing	Not to red or overbearing
Martha S.	5	Beautiful color	This is my first time to try this lipstick and I'm very pleased. The color is beautiful and very flattering and does last quite a while. This might seem like a minor point but I love that it has absolutely no flavor. I never liked the taste of lipstick getting in my mouth. And my nervous habit is biting my lips and this lipstick really helps me not feel the urge to do that.
Debbie S.	5	Love the color	This lipstick stays on for a ver long time, keeps your lips moist and the color is very pretty. Great lipstick for the price. Already purchasing my second tube.
Nancy L.	5	Great product!	I purchased Huntress and Empowered. Each shade was exactly what I needed. The lipstick goes on smoothly, feels very soothing, and lasts for hours.

Great products and social responsibility, a real win-win.

Sparkie	5	Lovely texture and moisture	As the owner of 6 dogs, how could I resist this? The product arrived very quickly and I couldn't be happier with the quality. This is a soft, translucent color that has a natural look. I think anyone can wear this color. Moisturizing without be greasy. Love it!
Carol R.	5	No feathering!	This is nice lipstick and the colors are rich. It really doesn't feather! Will definitely purchase other colors in the future.
Joan M.	5	Love it!	The shade is perfect, not too dark or too light. It is one of my ‚Äúgo to‚Äù shades for every occasion. I‚Äôm 67, and I love that it stays on my lips and doesn‚Äôt bleed. Not drying at all.

I purchased the Neutrals Bundle first and the colors are a little light but still nice. Then a week later I purchased the Strong Women Pack and they are perfect.

Hilary S.	5	cashmere on my lips	All Color The World lipsticks that I have tried have felt like silk and go on more smoothly than any other lipstick that I have tried. Love that they are Vegan and that they don't stink like a lot of other lipsticks. Very natural feeling and the colors are beautiful.
Dale L.	5	I feel pretty.....	Pretty N‚Äô pink is a beautiful color for pink lovers. This brand of lipstick doesn‚Äôt bleed, and it doesn‚Äôt dry out your lips. They have a lot of beautiful shades and part of the purchase price goes to charity. If you haven‚Äôt already, give it a try!

Carol O.	5	My new favorite	I like everything about this lipstick! I have bought department store brands for years, but recently I have been disappointed in their formulations and color options.

Laura H.	5	Love the lipstick....	Unfortunately I chose colors that are too light for me. I still use them, love the feel. I‚Äôll order some darker shades soon.
Kim L.	5	Way Better than expected	I am usually disappointed with lipstick purchases. The color is never quite right. So when I got 3 lipsticks and I like every one of them, i am shocked. Also, they are a softer consistency so my lips don‚Äôt dry out. I had stopped wearing lipstick mostly. Now I look forward to putting some on every day.
Valerie S.	5	Best Yet	I love the Huntress color - it is so creamy and does not bleed and stays very moist. The color is perfect. I will be 70 next year and it is difficult to find lipstick that makes lips look fuller like this!

Sharon C.	5	Consistently Great	This is my second CTW lipstick, and it won't be my last. I love everything about them. In a world where product ads usually fall short of their hype, CTW lipsticks fulfill their promises. The colors are beautiful, and, with them, I don't worry about what I'm putting on my skin. No lead! No petroleum! Just safe, natural ingredients. Thank you, CTW.

Kathy T.	5	Just as advertised	The colors were as pictured. I am sixty so I was pleased the lipstick did not settle into the fine lines around my lips. I was very pleased there was no unpleasant "taste" to this lipstick. I will definitely order again.
Liz R.	5	Flawless new Lipstick	I was so happy when I received the package. But when I open it, I love the lipstick case so pretty and feminine. I couldn't wait to try it on. I love the way it went so smooth on my lips. What an awesome product. I just love it! It's been a while since I had such a good quality liptick. It's also awesome that when I purchase a lipstick it's helping the world by giving back. I will be purchasing more and sharing this web page.
Maria D.	5	Great lipstick	This lipstick is very moisturizing but at the same time feels like nothing on the lips. Has a nice pigmentation & lasts for a pretty long time. I bought Coral Reef and I really like it.
Karen S.	5	I love this color	This is a great color for me. love the way it goes on and it stays on well.
Agnes G.	5	I finally found a lipstick I love	Since I consider myself ‚Äúseasoned‚Äù it has been difficult to find lipstick I like. No glitter, it‚Äôs matte finish is just what I wanted and last long without drying my lips.
Kathy P.	5	Great product!	I love this lipstick, will buy again!

Patricia S.	5	Soft lips	My lips are softer, smoother, and seem to be fuller! I love the colors, too
Elizabeth S.	5	Great!	I waited several days before reviewing to give me time to decide on comfort, color, etc. I find it to be a great lipstick; it wears well and lasts long. I am 76 years old and have trouble finding lipstick that remains comfortable; this one does. I have not had any problems with feathering; stays put. I see some complaints about color not being exactly as it appears on-line and mine was slightly different. That, though, is because computers exhibit color differently from one to another. Read the advice on the website. Think quite helpful. So - an A+
Mary D.	5	Very nice lip treatment.	Very nice lip treatment.
Lynn R.	5	Nice little lip saver	This is a nice compact lip balm that smells wonderful. Love the colored lipsticks too!
Linda K.	5	A new day	I finally have lipsticks that don‚Äôt bleed, disappear or get dry. I bought the Strong Women‚Äôs set. I now have the moisture I need with a light, colorful lipstick that doesn‚Äôt age me. Great product! I will buy more shades.

Sharon P.	5	Perfect	Great color, great consistancy. Stays on!
Melissa F.	5	Took a gamble and won!	All three lipsticks delivered! Beautiful, creamy- and doesn‚Äôt bleed all over my lower face! I have also gotten compliments on the colors.

Patricia R.	5	Jazzy Lip Colors	I really like the Glam Pack which includes lip colors Rose Gold, Confident and Irresistible---three beautiful colors that go on smoothly and stay on much longer than other lipsticks I've purchased from department stores, etc... Will definitely order these colors again and more colors in the very near future. Thanks a million!!!

Linda P.	5	I just love ‚ù§Ô∏è it	I just love ‚ù§Ô∏è it sooo... much! I get a little leery ordering without being able to sample the color but I took a chance and it was perfect!! Thank you!! Have a great day! ü•∞

Cheryl M.	5	Really love the lipstick. Does	Really love the lipstick. Does just what it claims to do!
Sue T.	5	The strong women pack	I love the lipsticks, they are creamy and don't bleed. My only complaint is the colors in this pack are very close in color. The picture made them look different from what I actually got, but I do like them.
Shari C.	5	Fabulous color...my favorite! Feels great!	Fabulous color...my favorite! Feels great!
Mary G.	5	Fabulous colors and smoothness-even young	Fabulous colors and smoothness-even young teen grands love it!!!!!
Kathleen S.	5	Very nice lipstick. The color	Very nice lipstick. The color is perfect rise. The lipstick is moist. It helps prevent crack chapped lips.
Gleita E.	5	Flawless - perfect name for lip color and the cause	I live in Arizona so this color is great for year-round wear plus it makes the lips feel great and the color blends with so many outfits regardless of the season. (when using it I must remember not to have "foundation" on my hands so that I can keep the outer cute tube fresh and pretty.
Lisa K.	5	Best lipstick ever	Love very pleased
Deborah R.	5	Perfect color for daily wear	I recently fell in love with Color the World lipsticks. They are moisturizing and long lasting and I love the idea that a portion of each purchase is contributed to different organizations. Huntress is the perfect neutral color for me...not too light, not too dark. I have been searching for a natural looking shade for years and now I have found it. Love it!
HB	5	Love these lipsticks!	So happy I purchased this trio of lipsticks! They feel good on my lips and layer nicely too! am going to purchase the trio of neutrals next!
Carol D.	5	Best New Lipstick	Really liked this lipstick, it stays on and does not feather on your lips, which is a big plus. The color was spot on and I received several compliments on the pretty color.
Patty E.	5	No bleed, AMAZING!!!	If you ask my kids they'll tell you, you'll very rarely see me without lipstick! However, as I'm aging it's been so frustrating that all my lipsticks bleed. I've used lip scrub, clear lip liner to go around the edges and more but nothings worked . . . until now! I still use lip liner (habit) but I LOVE THIS LIPSTICK!!! NO BLEED AND BEAUTIFUL COMPLEMENTARY COLORS to my every outfit!! Worth every $$$$$$$
Karen W.	5	Very good	Feels good, looks good
Carole C.	5	Tickle your fancy...	Tickled Pink lipstick is purrrfect for that bright sexy look. The semi-matte finish  does not run into the fine ageing lines around my lips. CC
Lisa R.	5	Love this color!	Speechless is a wonderful true flattering red. It was brighter than I had expected, thinking that the vegetable base wouldn't hold a bright color. I was so wrong!!--and it doesn't bleed into any lines around your lips! I also love the charity this color supports!! Win/win!
Elena R.	5	No more feathering!	These lipsticks absolutely do no feather. I have a huge problem with this with all other lipsticks. I have five different colors now, and I will never use any other kind of lipstick.
Irene A.	5	I received my lipstick and	I received my lipstick and I just love love the color and the way it feels..also feels great in my heart that I'm also helping others..thank u again Going to order some more really soon.
Colleen D.	5	Foxy - 'Alzheimer's Awareness'	Awesome color -- looks great for summer and will look perfect for the fall!!! Goes really well with my very fair skin and very grey hair!!! (And no, I am only in my early 60's)!!!
Cheryl R.	5	Heartfelt	Heartfelt is a 'soft' red which is perfect for those of us with light grey, blond or white hair. Not a 'blue red', it makes my face glow.
Pam H.	5	Review on my Heartfelt lipstick	I am VERY pleased! The lipstick goes on smooth, does not "bleed" and looks very good. I also really like the cute tube and design; I always felt bad about throwing away previous expensive lipstick tubes, thinking, "why don't they recycle?" I will promote your product to my friends and assure them it is a good product. Love the uniqueness of your donating to worthy causes with purchases, as well.
Karen L.	5	Nice subtle red	I like this red for when I don't want a lipstick that stands out. It brightens my lips, and makes them redder, but without calling to attention that I'm wearing lipstick.
Suzanne D.	5	Great summer color!	Creamy and bright (but not too bright), Foxy is my new favorite! Definitely perfect for the summer!
Carolyn A.	5	Goddess	The color is a burgundy blue/red which is very pretty and exactly what I was looking for! I love that these lipsticks stay only on the lips!!
Bette N.	5	For my bright days	Gives me a lift just to see how bright my face looks
Gail G.	5	Love This Lipstick	This lipstick is such a beautiful shade. It's creamy and long lasting. I also love how the product is packaged. I bought four different shades and this is one of my favorites for sure.
Karen L.	5	Love the color	The perfect red - not too bright, not too dark, just a little blue (but not a plum).
Gloria B.	5	Wonderful Lipsticks!	I'm so glad I discovered these lipsticks! Great colors. Long lasting. Easily applied. Environmentally-friendly containers. Quick shipping. Thank you!
Jane C.	5	Sunset	Creamy, clear color, feels good
Arthur D.	5	Rose Gold - A Favorite	This is (so far my favorite color from CTW.  I have rosy cheeks and red hair and it is a complementary color for me. This one is a bit deeper colored than the other summer warm pinks I am wearing, so I tend to use it for evening (not fancy, just shows up in the lesser artificial lights). I expect I will use it in the daytime once autumn comes.  It may have a light metallic element, but that just gives it a soft highlighted effect.  Definitely Recommended.
Marilyn M.	5	Nice to support a worthy	Nice to support a worthy charity while beautifying my aging lips üëÑ!!
Mary C.	5	Empowered	This is a good lipstick,love it,
Susan D.	5	Love it	I really love this lipstick. I‚Äôm 72 and too many lip products just don‚Äôt work well for me. This one is great
Amelia M.	5	Great lipsticks!	Great lipsticks!
Leslie S.	5	Long Lasting	The color goes with everything and lasts hours longer than any lipstick I‚Äôve used in the past.
Kathy M.	5	Wonderful!	Creamy and long lasting
Carol A.	5	Gorgeous, Flattering and Luscious	I couldn't be happier with my first Color The World lipstick in Empowered. I love its emollient formula which is very flattering and makes my teeth look especially white. I'm awaiting my second order now in another color. I've FINALLY found the right lipstick palette for my skin tone at age 74. Thank you and keep up your good works.
Lorraine M.	5	Best lipstick ever!!	This lipstick is by far the best I ever purchased. Colors are great, do not feather, & last at least 6 hours. I am so very happy I found it, plus the nice people give to a very worthy cause. Love it!!
Elena P.	5	A good cause	I bought this lipstick because depression had affected my family personally, and anything that helps research into the cause and therapeutic approaches is a great thing as far as I‚Äôm concerned.  You support a lot of great humane causes, and your lipstick quality is excellent. I also like that beauty can and should be cruelty free.  Keep up the good work!
Janet H.	5	Glamorous!	This is a perfect name for this glamorous color and just right for a night on the town. It can be worn for daytime as well, but I really like it for dressing up my look for going out. It also works well as a base when blending other colors.
Dawn H.	5	I love your lipstick!	I love your lipstick!
Carol r.	5	This is my first purchase	This is my first purchase of the Rose Gold and was pleased with the gold shimmer/shine and same creamy texture as the other lipsticks.
Susan P.	5	Love this lipstick!	Great colors and no feathering!
Hannah W.	5	Love this lipstick	One of the biggest things for me with darker lipstick is ‚Äúgraceful degradation‚Äù, i.e. do I end up with a weird ring around my lips or does it wear off evenly enough to get away with it? This looks great on and wears off in a not awkward way. Love it.
Sally T.	5	Lovin‚Äô It	This lipstick is very neutral and perfect for those days when you want just a bit of ‚Äúzing‚Äù to pep up your overall look. As ever, this lipstick does not feather (wow factor) or fade after hours of wear. Love the texture. I am buying these lipsticks for all my friends and family!
Jeanette M.	5	Empowered!	Wonderful
Karen L.	5	Very Happy with Wildflower	This color is amazing. It looks great with my skin tone.
Monica C.	5	Great lipstick	I left a review for Wild Flower. Feeling the same about Cashmere and Mint to Be! Happy and will continue to purchase from Color the World. Thank you for a fabulous product!
Karalee M.	5	Moisturizing. Beautiful colors.	Moisturizing. Beautiful colors.
Julie H.	5	A little bit orange, a little bit of pink	I love the color, a little orange color mixed with pink. Lipstick is in a lovely tube, goes on smoothly and keeps your lips moisturized. A good purchase...and I have ‚Äúolder‚Äù lips!
Carol r.	5	Empowered is so far my	Empowered is so far my favorite color. It is a great everyday color.
Debbie C.	5	Empowered	Love the color and texture of this lipstick. Goes on smooth color last and my lips feel so kissable. Wish I would have found this years ago.
Linda B.	5	Pretty N' Pink great lipstick!	The color is saturated and gives a very pretty sheen.
Dorothy S.	5	Beautiful color, goes with most everything.	As with the other two lipsticks I purchased, I love the way it feels on. No feathering, just lovely lipstick.

Jaki K.	5	Wonderful color!	I love the color and the moisture! I plan on buying many more!
Jan E.	5	Rose Petal	This is a beautiful color but a little darker than I wanted. I will mix it with another color that I have and hopefully get the perfect color for me. It feels very creamy and the color lasts a long time.
Linda M.	5	Love it!	This is an excellent choice of lipstick. It is a wonderful neutral shade for my medium complexion. It moisturizes, does not feather and glides on beautifully.
Paige T.	5	The BEST lipsticks	I can‚Äôt endorse these enough. The colors are great with ingredients I like and they support causes I really believe in too. I‚Äôll buy again !
Belinda M.	5	Great color	Great color
Cathy W.	5	Wonderful lipstick!	Super moisturizing and color lasts all day! Love this neutral color!!
Colleen D.	5	Foxy - 'Alzheimer's Awareness'	Love this color -- looks great with all of my shades of pink and reds!!! (Red is my favorite color -- it provides just enough color, and hints at more!) This is the first lip color that I have worn that my husband looked at me and said you look great with make-up; and all I had on was this lip color, nothing else!!! I think I better go back and buy out the stock!!!!
Margie S.	5	Lovin this color	I can't ever seen to find a lipstick that I really like. The color isn't what I thought it would be, doesn't stay on good, or something. But my new Empowered by Color the World is fantastic! I love the color, and it goes on so nice! This is my new favorite and I will definitely by buying again!
Jodi P.	5	Great and Wonderful Product	I had purchased the Pretty N' Pink and it does not feather and stays on for awhile. It is creamy and the color is fabulous. I highly recommend these lipsticks. They don't feel as if you are really wearing anything, but you are! Love the lipstick. Thank you.
Karen S.	5	Very nice love it	Very nice love it
Debbie P.	5	Wonderful	I love this lipstick. No bleeding onto skin. Color stays on my lips much longer than others. Also the colors are true to pictures. Love the container. Will be buying more.

Mary K.	5	Empowered	This color is perfect with my skin tone. Very happy with my purchase.
Susan T.	5	Foxy	Really beautiful wearing and feeling lipstick! My only critique is I wish there was a Little bit more pigment. You have to use quite a bit if you want to achieve color. Maybe it‚Äôs this particular color but I still would highly recommend trying this lipstick.
Lily L.	5	bright color	I love the bright color and keep my lips moist.
Lorraine H.	5	Love companies that give back	Love the company, love the lipstick!

Kirsten N.	5	Great formula and colors!	I'm very pale and have dark hair, and these colors all look great! They last much longer than my Mac favorites, and are a tiny bit drying, but not at all like most other long-wearing options. Also, I'm very sensitive to "flavor" of lip products, intentional or not. This one is kind of the traditional makeup scent/flavor but very mild. It's the only thing I'd change but since I'm not actually eating it, not a big deal. :) I'm looking forward to getting more of these for myself and my daughter.
Evelyn B.	5	Love the colors	Love the lipstick!

Daughn P.	5	perfect colors for redheads	All four colors I ordered are perfect for the fall as well as anyone having a fair complexion and auburn hair. Revolutionary is a beautiful warm reddish brown color. Customer service is first rate.
Beth E.	5	Lipstick with a Cause	This is my first purchase from your company. I like that your product is connected to a cause. I bought the Huntress and it is a nice subtle everyday shade. Meantime, it keeps to its promise and does not feather. So, I will be purchasing more lipsticks from you in the future.

Joyce F.	5	Beautiful colors	I love the colors and the lipstick goes on so smooth! I like, but not overjoyed, with the tube-wish it had a clear top so that I can see the color without opening...did I mention that I, like many seniors, experience macular degeneration and cannot read the printed color on bottom of tube? Iregardless, love this liostick!!
Gail G.	5	Another Win!!	These lipsticks are so creamy and go on smoothly. The colors are rich, not stark. I just love the packaging of them too. So pretty.
Cheryl B.	5	Love It	I enjoy putting it on every time I head outside into the sun.
Jo D.	5	AT LAST!!!	Finally a lipstick that is wonderful for many reasons‚Ä¶.. 1. The colors are perfect. The sorting of cool and warm skin tones skin is an excellent feature for choosing the right color. 2. Lipsticks stays on after many hours. 3. The cases are made of paper not plastic. It makes my makeup pouch with all my ‚Äúmust carry items‚Äù lighter. Different cases for different colors makes identifying the right lipstick. I carry more than one lipstick. 4. Lots of great causes to support.

Dianne F.	5	My second order!	I love this lipstick. I ordered "Kisses" the first time I sent in an order and loved the color so much I ordered it again. I also ordered the Lip Conditioner. I am very happy with that item as well. Both go on so smoothly and do not dry my lips out like other lipsticks.
Marilyn P.	5	My only make-up	I don't normally use make-up, and lip color only on special occasions. I like that the moisturizing feel and subtle shade makes it comfortable to wear every day.
Deb G.	5	Flawless Lipstick	Love the actual lipstick and the texture. Just wish I could purchase instore so I can test the colors. These are too light and pink for me, I dont consider them neutral. Fabulous lipstick though.
Rita I.	5	A winner, again	This is my second tube of Southern Red. I love this color. There are several shades of red offered by Color The World and I‚Äôm a fan of most. Southern Red, for me, is a color that looks great with navy, black, white, grey, silver, gold. For some, this shade of red may be too bright. If you want your lipstick to make a statement on certain occasions this is a good color. And, of course, CTW lipstick feels great. I find that I apply CTW often if I want the color to look fresh but this lipstick can be applied once and there is color for a long while, just more faint and more ‚Äònatural‚Äô. I have at least 13 shades and use most of them. There have been a couple of colors that weren‚Äôt right for me but the others are wonderful. I have found that CTW are my ‚Äògo to‚Äô favorites.
Fiona S.	5	So glad I found you	Love my new Lipstick‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èColor, feel, staying power 10 out of 10.

Margie W.	5	Making A Difference	My biggest reason for ordering my Color the World lipstick was for the beautiful, cardboard packaging. I‚Äôll jump on any product that will help reduce plastic. What a bonus though! The lipstick is wonderful on like any expensive brand! The colors are what I expected; beautiful mauves in my case. What can I say; natural lipstick, outstanding color & wear, good price, benefits a cause, plastic reduction & American made; it rings all the bells for me. I carry a tube at all times to share with my friends & acquaintances. Have heard only positive responses to the color on me & the appeal of the packaging. Several have written down your web site. I hope Color My World goes round the world!
Diana G.	5	Feels good	This color has a creamy feeling to it and I‚Äôve gotten compliments on it, which has never happened to me with a lipstick before. I‚Äôm told it looks great with my skin color which is fair.

Stephanie G.	5	Love My Strong Woman Pack	I can't begin to say how many lipsticks I've bought that don't work for me--either they turn orange or they flake off or the color ends up wearing me. I was amazed that I loved every single one of these colors, which are the ultimate my lips but better shades. I am so pleased, have told friends about them and will definitely go back for more.
Toni R.	5	Luxurious	I love this lipstick so much I immediately bought another tube.

That made it affordable for me.  I love it. The best I have ever used. Love the color, the feel on my lips and the fact it is better for the earth and my body. All good. I will order again.

Anne D.	5	Lipstick that stays put!	I love the color and the feeling of this lipstick. At my age (68) I have those pesky lines around my lips, but this one doesn‚Äôt end up in those lines. I ordered another color yesterday and can‚Äôt wait to try it! I love the fact that it‚Äôs all natural ingredients and when you purchase, some money helps various charities. You can‚Äôt lose!

April C.	5	gorgeous color in all three that	i have bought so far. Feels like heaven on your lips. I used to use lip gloss, chap stick, carmex, and some high end skin products to keep lips feeling good. This lipstick alone does the job - and you don't have to apply it often. Wonderful stuff. Will buy more. I will need more since I have started wearing it to bed (have navy blue sheets). And it does some good. Total package.

Tonya B.	5	I tried it. I liked it!	I bought this lipstick just because I wanted to throw support behind a cause, half expecting that I‚Äôd throw it in the trash after a couple of uses. Surprise! This is genuinely a great product. It glides on smoothly and the color is there without being overpowering. It‚Äôs now among my favorites in the cosmetics drawer!

Christy	5	I love shopping with a purpose!	I purchased 3 of these lipsticks! And, I love that each one had a cause that received a donation. Purpose means everything to me. Vegan also means a lot to me. I love the cute containers. I love the colors. I'm so happy to have found this company and have shared it with my friends.
MarieT	5	Stays on all day And Looks Fantastic	This lipstick is amazing. It stays on all day, is not sticky or slippery, and looks amazingly natural. Can't say enough.

Jamie J.	5	The Holy Grail of lipsticks	I don‚Äôt normally write reviews, but I am not normally so impressed. I have spent hundreds of dollars over the years looking for a red lipstick that I could pull off. Something that brightens my face yet doesn‚Äôt make my teeth look yellow, my face washed out, doesn‚Äôt look smeary, isn‚Äôt too matte or too shiny - you know the drill. I took the plunge here because of all the pictures shared, and I dipped in BIG because of the coupon you get on your first order, buying 8 total: Heartfelt, Confident, Foxy, Wildflower, Southern Red (thinking this one would be a stretch - so RED), Huntress, Flirt and Glamberry. Ladies, they are ALL gorgeous. There is something magical about the formulation of the lipsticks. It‚Äôs not just the colors, it‚Äôs the way they go on. Buildable, yet very pigmented. They feel like a lipbalm. They don‚Äôt budge off my lips yet are full of color. I think ‚Äúnatural‚Äù is the wrong word for a red lipstick, so maybe ‚Äúeffortless‚Äù fits best. It‚Äôs the kind of lipstick you can put on without a mirror! I‚Äôm completely shocked that every color looked good, especially after my aforementioned struggle with finding a single ONE red that would work for me. For comparative reference, I have dark brown hair, green eyes, freckles, and wear light to medium neutral-warm foundation. My favorite is Hearfelt because it‚Äôs sort of a complex red - leaning a little coral. Second is surprisingly Southern Red. Confident is really similar to Southern Red but you notice the gold in it. Huntress is a perfect neutral that begs for intense eye makeup to balance it. My least favorite is Wildflower - it‚Äôs just a little too light with my skin tone, feels like something my mother would have worn in the 60s. Foxy is the only one that didn‚Äôt look true to the pictures on the site - it leans more purple than I was expecting. Flirt and Glamberry are not as extreme as I was expecting, just pretty, completely wearable. Overall, I‚Äôm completely thrilled and will be wearing these daily, recommending them to my mom and sister, all my friends - the only lipsticks I‚Äôll ever buy again.
Eleanor P.	5	Flawless	I admit it I am very picky about lipstick. I think this lipstick lives up to expectations. The only time I had some running was when I ate greasy sausage with peppers and onions and baked beans. I would not expect lipstick to Hold Up with that kind of dinner. One of the sides of my upper lip is smaller than the other side so I need to go over the natural lip line a little bit to make it look a little bit more even and I can do that with this lipstick. It has a very good coverage. The flawless shade is very light, and I like that. I plan to order another one a little darker. Elly
L g.	5	Great colors	I love these lipsticks, the colors are soft, not overpowering, so they're good for everyday use. They last for hours and make my lips feel soft and moisturized. I'd recommend these!
Deborah S.	5	Empowered	My absolute favorite is Empowered. I received a 3pk. But my favorite is still Empowered. Wonderful lipsticks!
Linda K.	5	Love THIS COLOR!!	Rose Gold is a fantastic color and one I will be ordering over and over again. Thanks to wearing wigs, I am sometimes a blonde, redhead or silver gray and Rose Gold goes beautifully with all those hair colors, even if you fake it or have it naturally!!!
Victoria C.	5	Fun color	This lipstick made me step out of my comfort zone. I always wear muted colors-which I love. But, I think I've found a new go-to in "Foxy"!
Cassandra B.	5	Gorgeous Red!	This is a stunningly beautiful deep, warm red...somewhat sheer, yet buildable to a darker color. One oft favorites!
Donna R.	5	Pretty lips	Love this lipstick. Great color. goes on smoothly and the case is very pretty. I will buy again and recommend to friends.
Sally W.	5	The color is great	Love the color of this lipstick! Not pink, not beige, not red but a pretty mixture of all!
Tina T.	5	Feeling Fresh Bundle	I‚Äôve been wearing Chanel lipstick for as long as I can remember. I thought I‚Äôd give this a try because of my age (65). I am shocked to feel how smooth they go on. And the fact that the company is charitable gives me a reason to switch.
Christine D.	5	My New Favorite	This is a deep rich red with blue undertones. Applies smoothly and evenly with no dryness. Out of the 5 Color the World lipsticks I own, this is by far my favorite.
Nancy S.	5	Great product	so happy with how good this lipstick feels on my lips. Never feels dry and the colors are amazing.I wear it every day.
Cindy M.	5	Happy Lips!	As a woman over 60 I‚Äôm glad that I found this line of lipstick. It go‚Äôs on really creamy and i have a tint of color at the end of every day with only one morning application. It is not bleeding out as much as most lipsticks do and it‚Äôs so much more comfortable on my lips than those all day lipsticks that dry but require all day application of glossy sealer. Love the neutral color Empowered the most from this pack with today‚Äôs choice of Independent is running a close second.  I also love that my purchase helps to fund causes for others.
Susan W.	5	Love it	Love the color and texture.
Dorie V.	5	Love	I have been wearing the same brand of lipstick for over 10 years, then I saw this product and decided to give it a try. I must say I‚Äôm a believer! I love the smooth consistency and the vibrant colors. I was worried I would have to reapply often however the color lasts all day! Most of all I love the simplicity of the Ingredients and the company‚Äôs mission to give back. I can‚Äôt wait to own the entire collection!
Janis K.	5	Great!	This is one of 5 I purchased. Definitely brighter than I usually wear but it's a great color and I'm having fun wearing it.
Carla D.	5	My favorite!!	I love, love, love this color!! It is such a beautiful shade and it looks really good and again...No Bleeding on my mature face.

Knowing what this color supports gives me more self confidence and a big smile!! I will be purchasing more!! Great product!! üíã

Patricia P.	5	Great Product	not only is the product great, but the customer service is great too. Would recommend to all my friends.
Elizabeth M.	5	Fabulous lipstick!	I like to try new lipsticks and I loved the idea of supporting good causes. I chose the "Empowerment" color because it helps a good cause, depression & anxiety, both of which I live with everyday. The color is perfect for me. It's full color, creamy but not too shiny. Cute packaging too. Stays on well, doesn't smear. Please add new colors. Definitely recommend!
Betty J.	5	I really like the lipstick	I really like the lipstick the color is great and it doesn't run into the lines around my lips
Jill R.	5	Empowered	I live the way it glides on and the way it protects my lips. It‚Äôs like the lip gloss I could never find. It‚Äôs the exact color of my lips. How funny is that? But still great for a gloss.
Catherine R.	5	A good purchase	This lipstick goes on smooth and makes my lips so soft. Fast shipping and a great price.l have a medium complexion with cool undertones. The Dragon Fruit is a good color for me.
Rosalie Z.	5	New Favorite Lipstick	I wish I wore lipstick more. Soft, creamy and the color actually looked like what was shown on the website. That doesn't ever happen even in the store when holding it in your hand. Love it.
Chris C.	5	Works as advertised!	Goes on easily, stays moist on the lips, does not turn a different color after application and does NOT feather into those fine lines around the mouth.
Marilyn A.	5	Absolutely soft but vibrant red!	If you've always worn reds, as I have, but you might now find your favorite red shades suddenly too stark and pinks do not suit you, this shade is truly perfect! I never thought a red could be subtle yet still deliver the punch an aging complexion might still require. Well, here it is! My new favorite. It is a true red, more on the cool side, like ripe strawberries. This shade has compelled me to try Southern Red, to see if my luck holds! Please, don't ever discontinue "Speechless". Women over 40 (over 60, in fact) will continue to forever bless you for it!
Rosa P.	5	Empowered Help Tiumph Over Anxiety and Depression	Just used the lipstick and I am very pleased with the color.
Pam W.	5	Love the colors and how	Love the colors and how smooth it goes on! No feathering either!
Elsa W.	5	The Best	I've tried lots of different lipsticks and this is by far the best. Long lasting without drying out. The colors are just a shown and are the same when you put them on. I love this lipstick . I've thrown all my others out and have ordered more colors from Color The World
Gina L.	5	Beautiful üòä	Love this lipstick üíÑ goes on smooth, the color is gorgeous and most important love the cause.
Patricia F.	5	Go on soooo smoothly	These lipsticks go on beautifully! Love the colors too.
Linda K.	5	Excellent colors and fantastic colors!!	I really like the Feeling Fresh bendle because ALL the colors are so good and clear and clean feeling they can be worn day or night. None of the colors I chose are muddy looking. Actually, I don;t believe ANY of Color the World colors are muddy. At least the 7 I ordered aren't!
Debbie V.	5	Think I just may start loving my lipsticks!	As I am fair complected and very light blond, I've always sighed away from any darker lipstick shades.....and now that I am a "tad" older, I was really afraid to "experiment". However, your Rose Gold intrigued me, so I gave it a try and.....I love it! The shade is soft and classy!
Cindy C.	5	Lovely lips	I bought two different 3 packs. A couple are darker than I would wear. I have worn three different colors and like them very much. Cute packaging...no smell and no leaking into lines as promised!
Christine H.	5	Color	Love the color and the cause it goes to.
Sharon B.	5	Very nice!	I was afraid that this color would be too light, but it is lovely on! A very pretty summer nude that darkens just slightly on me and appears to add a little volume. Very nice!
Cynthia M.	5	Great lipstick!	This lipstick exceeds the description! I just love it. So much so that I ordered again right after I took Empowered out of the package.
Sandra N.	5	Great for layering	I love to layer lipsticks to get just the right shade or effect. With dark colors, just a dab on the lower lip for a perfect pout, or all over to tone down shades. Can be alone if you want a pale lip (shade lighter than a nude lip).
Susan T.	5	Great lipstick	I am very pleased with my new lipstick .. shipping was quick .. and it‚Äôs a great product
Valerie S.	5	EMPOWERED	This is my first time trying this shade. As with all the others I've purchased, this lipstick goes on smooth and stays put. As a 60 something, I have fine lip lines and used to apply lip primer before adding color. I can skip that step now that I'm using CTW products. I like this particular color since it gives my lips healthy looking natural color without screaming "Lipstick". Its a good color to start off my day and perhaps use a stronger color later in the day. I'm very happy I tried this brand.
Peggy Z.	5	I love this product. It's	I love this product. It's very smooth and stays on all day long. I will be purchasing more. Thanks
Andrea H.	5	Excellent	After years of buying lipsticks that disappointed me, I‚Äôve finally found the perfect lipstick. These go on easily, feel good on my lips, don‚Äôt feather, and stay on. The colors are beautiful without being too bright, and no scent or taste! I‚Äôm really excited about this product! Try them. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.
Ann W.	5	Lovely colors	These lipsticks --I've got 3 now -- are true to the colors advertised. They don't turn dark when applied or face into a shadow of the advertised shade. Great color selection in my view. Also, the lipsticks are creamy, slide on easily, and last for hours, another big factor for me. Really glad I found this brand!
Karen S.	5	Pretty in Pink	A lovely peachy pink blended colour that looks good with a wide range of palette .
Bkranjac	5	Great bundle for reddish colors	This is a bundle of 3 red shades. Glamberry is my favorite color ever, it suits my skintone perfectly. I wanted something more red to try. Southern red is clear red, abd will look good on both fair and darker skin tones. Girls night out has pink undertone and I do like it, but blends more for me that I would like. All in all, good bundle, although glamberry stays a winner.
Tinkerbelles	5	The good reviews aren‚Äôt hype	The color is beautiful. The shimmer is just enough to help my thin lips look fuller. It really does add moisture to my lips, last a long time, and not require a lip pencil. The ingredients are good and not testing on animals is the only reason I considered this line. It‚Äôs amazingly all good.
Joni M.	5	I love the color and	I love the color and the lipstick fulfills all the promises it made for us older gals.

Alison B.	5	Perfect colors	I really love how this lipstick stays on & how I can put it on without a mirror & not worry about it looking weird. It just always looks like a smooth natural color. I look forward to picking my color for the day & putting it on

Diane B.	5	Love it!!	I was so pleased with the ease of ordering for the first time, the fast time I received my order, and want you to know I am so happy with the way the lipstick stays on these older 69 yr. old lips. I liked it so much I ordered three more tubes, and am so happy with them also. Thank-you for bringing us such a great product, and for the donations you make towards great causes.

Alana D.	5	Perfection	I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased! As I have gotten older and let my hair grow naturally gray, I have embraced a softer look with my makeup. Your lipsticks work perfectly. When I apply them, they go on with ease because the texture is soft but firm. The color goes exactly where it is applied and stays there so I don‚Äôt feel I need to check it from time to time to make sure it‚Äôs still okay. I love everything about them.
Anita M.	5	I love these lipsticks!	I love these lipsticks!
Darlene O.	5	Kisses Lipstick	Absolutely love this lipstick!! Wasn‚Äôt sure ordering the shade but it‚Äôs perfect Thanks for a great product
Cathy O.	5	Wonderful colors	Lipstick turns orange on me. Always. I might like a color in the store or on someone else but it won‚Äôt work for me. I took a chance with the Glam Pack and I‚Äôm glad I did. All three colors stay true AND it stays on my lips-no spreading. I highly recommend Color the World products.

Linda A.	5	flawless lipstick	Was so excited to get this new lipstick-love the tube and the color suits my complexion to a tee. At 65 years old -most lipsticks made me look WAY older.

Patricia D.	5	Dont usually wear lipstick...	I'm 72 and other than a bit of eye liner that's it for my "make up ".

Quite pleased with this my first purchase...goes on...stays on...looks good!!! .. and... I like the cardboard tube!

Lillie J.	5	Feels great!	Love the lip treatment. Feels great on your lips and helps them not be dry.
Lorraine A.	5	Great lip moisturizer	This is a great treatment. I bought it the same time when I ordered my lipsticks, assuming I would need to use it on top of the lipstick, because so many lipsticks are drying these days, but it was absolutely unnecessary. The lipsticks are very hydrating on their own. I use this treatment to keep my lips soft, on days when I‚Äôm not wearing makeup and before going to bed.

They were wonderful and sent me 3 more. The product is superior to any ‚Äúold lady ‚Äú lipstick I have tried in the past. It really doesn‚Äôt bleed up those little pesky lines around your mouth.

Claudia D.	5	A lipstick, also for me!	I seldom listen to lipstick recommendations from my students because, in the past, I was never lucky at finding a lipstick for me.

Madeline G.	5	Good for me	It looks like a very intense color in the tube, but on my lips, it becomes light and easy going. The hue is right for me, something I've been searching for for a while, and the texture is smooth and creamy, nourishing. I plan on buying more, one to put on before I leave my house and another for my makeup kit to take with me.

I will definitely tell my friends and colleagues and will be purchasing more. And the added bonus of also doing something good feels great!! Thank you for what you guys do!!
Laura G.	5	Great Stuff!	It's a must-have for a base under any lipstick or gloss. I use it as a primer and let it sit for a bit before I apply my lipstick, OR if my lipstick is a little worn/getting spotty, an application of this seems to rejuvenate it and it's wonderful. I'll never go without it again.
Nona W.	5	Lip treatment	I have tried many lip moisturizer and this is by far the best.
Jane P.	5	Great for dry lips!	Soothing and moisturizing, love the hint of mint!
Amy C.	5	Loved my lipsticks	I loved this bundle of lipsticks - a very fun approach to packaging that also isn't wasteful or harmful to the environment. When I received them, they were so lightweight - I had NO idea if there was even a lipstick in them, but sure enough they are beautiful lipsticks within! I would (and will) buy this product over and over. Lovely quality - very smooth to apply! Feel good about this purchase and I will for sure recommend to my friends and everyone!
Sue W.	5	Love this one !!!	Great lip stick.
Patricia M.	5	Lovely color	Lovely color
Jennifer B.	5	Rose Gold For the Win	I'm 49 and just starting to deal with the lipstick creeping into the lines around my lips. I tried all sorts of lipstick from the grocery store and beauty shops but didn't have much success. The Color the World lipstick I tried actually works really well and doesn't have a weird perfume smell. It stayed on through a meal and drinks too!!
Susan S.	5	Color the World	These are the best lipsticks ever,they are so very smooth and they stay on your lips not in the creases which I love
Bonnie B.	5	In the Red!	This is one time it's okay to be in the RED! I just started using your lipsticks and I love this color red. I got one for myself and one for my sister and we couldn't be happier. We especially like putting the mint lip conditioner over top, it actually makes it stay on better. So thank you from my whole family! Keep up the good work!
Ann D.	5	Great lip treatment	This Lip Treatment is the best. My limps are soft and smooth. It's also excellent under the lip color as well.
Jane V.	5	Love it!	Finally i found a lipstick that stays on, does not feather into creases and is creamy and the cases are so much fun. i want every color. i recommend these lipsticks for everyone no matter what age. i love that each tube supports a cause.
Robin A.	5	Using as Blush	I wish you also sold blush. I use the lipstick for both lips and blush!
Aaron E.	5	Great Lipstick and color	Lipstick is creamy and goes on smooth without bleeding. love the color - not too bold but colorful
Nanette T.	5	Love this stuff!	Love the minty smell & how it makes my lips feel so soft!
Cindy W.	5	Very nice	Use every night before bed. Works wonderfully to keep lips from drying out overnight. Smells nice as well.
Sharon B.	5	Love it!!	Love it!!
Eileen B.	5	The ads are correct!	I am always reluctant to purchase anything advertised on social media. However, Color the World lipsticks are what they are advertised to be. Smooth and no bleeding and the price is about a third what I usually pay for lipsticks!
Nancy P.	5	Shades	The Shades I bought were a little to light for me, so I gave to my granddaughter. I prefer a darker shade, but i love the fact they didn't "feather"
Jan S.	5	Lipstick	I like it just fine!! Have 3 tubes!!
Wilma A.	5	Fabulous Lipsticks!	These lipsticks actually do what they advertise. They do not run into the fine lines around my lips. I am very impressed. I love them!
Cindy B.	5	Dreaming about Dreamer	Perfect lipstick! Great color, very flattering, and the color stays with you. Your lips stay moisturized, and it doesn't feather. This is a must have!
Cat B.	5	As good as I hoped!	Light, minty, long lasting and vegan too! Can‚Äôt go wrong here. It is in my purse with Flawless! Thank you for being as good as I hoped.
Doreen H.	5	Love this Color	Love this Color
Marilyn W.	5	Creamy Lipstick	I purchased this lipstick for my daughter and me. The main thing I notice about it is how creamy it feels to the lips when applied. It also provides a crisp outline to the lips with no lipstick runs.
Mary K.	5	color the world	I love the color and the consistency.
Ann D.	5	Pretty Color	This is my go to color when I get dressed up. Very pretty and not too dark. I love this product.

Rosalind R.	5	I really like it	Although I really like it I attempted to put on top of lip gloss, it does not pair well. It sort of balled up. However, alone its very smooth and pretty. Soft color for WOC. Only negative would be I wish it were longer wear. Love that money goes to Charity too!
Patricia M.	5	Wonderful color	Wonderful color
Cindy M.	5	Love it	Love it
Catherine M.	5	Very soothing!	I have extremely dry lips and this product provides immediate soothing with just the right amount of mint.
Misti A.	5	YUM	This is so moisturizing and so long-lasting! Worth every penny, and for a good cause!
Deborah R.	5	Mint to be	I love this product. I am an older woman, in my 60's, and my lips are not the same as they used to be. It truly helps with the lines and keeps my lips moist. I always use it before applying my lipstick and I put it on before bed. Sometimes I just wear it without any lipstick and it gives my lips a glow. I bought a similar product from a salon and it was more expensive but did not work as well. I will surely buy this again.
Barbara P.	5	Great lipstick	I am very pleased with the Color the World lipstick.
Katie G.	5	Absolutely love this lip treatment.	Absolutely love this lip treatment. It is very soft and moisturizing. Great product!!!!

Lorraine D.	5	Colors and feel wonderful	I really love my lipsticks! The colors I selected look great and they feel wonderful. I wish it lasted longer but I am terrible about chewing this and any other lipstick off (the only one that stay on are so drying, I stopped using them).   Would love to be able to get a sampler with multiple colors so I could see how they look before buying a full tube.   Thanks for a great product at a GREAT price!
Ronnie A.	5	Excellent	Love the color and love the way it goes on. Doesn‚Äôt feel heavy on my lips.
Kenneth M.	5	Love it	Very smooth and light , gives great conditioning for dry lips!
Sandy K.	5	Fabulous color!	Great color. Goes on smooth. Lasts for hours without drying, traveling or caking. Finally, a product that does what it claims. Thank you!!
Teresita H.	5	I love the ‚ÄúMint To	I love the ‚ÄúMint To Be‚Äù Vegan Lip Treatment. It is so smooth and help my dry lips.
Sher	5	Love it!	Living in a desert climate, the drying affects really take a toll on skin and lips. I have been using the "MINT TO BE" VEGAN LIP TREATMENT every night when I go to bed, and my lips are noticeably softer, and I think fuller, because of the mint. It's also very pleasant tasting.
Brenda M.	5	Nice neutral color .	I really like this for just running around. I like a bite more color for dressing up.
Karie H.	5	Pretty color	Wildflower is a subtle blend of pink and peach. It's not too bright and not too nude. It complements my fair skin and blonde hair. Very age-appropriate! This is my first purchase from Color The World and I'm very glad I found your lipstick :-)
Diane K.	5	Pretty N' Pink	I love this one especially! They all stay on very well. I have stopped wearing heavy makeup because of my age. I have let the color grow off of my hair and now completely gray. These soft pops of color are just what I need to bring out my eyes.
Linda P.	5	The Perfect Lipstick!	I chose Empowered because it is in the cool family. I have tried every other lipstick on the market (not exaggerating) looking for a color like this...and this one is PERFECT! I'm in my early 70's and this color is neither bold or drab. Like I said...it is perfect for me! Doesn't feather which makes me very happy! I'll be back again for more shades. Thank you, Color the World!
Cynthia H.	5	My 4th Color My World	My 4th Color My World Lipstick and it didn't fail to disappoint. I like the bit of iridescent and laying it with my other CMW lipsticks. The color lasts long and all their colors are so true to the description. Shop, choose, click. What could be easier.
Virginia T.	5	Blue Red	I like the balm feel of the lipstick. I do like to use a liner with all my lipsticks. I will use one with this one, but you don't need it. It will smear if you eat, so please blot.
Wendy P.	5	Love this but.....	I have not been using for very long but I do like to mix it with one of the other colors I purchased in the 3 set. My only dislike is the three set I purchased (Flawless, Empowered and Independent) is that the three colors are very light this is why I mix them so as to get right shade. Next purchase will try darker that compliments my dark hair and fair complexion.
Meg W.	5	Bright and Beautiful	Loved everything about this. The texture, the staying power and the color. It is a great ‚Äúbrightening‚Äù shade that still looks very natural. It‚Äôs a keeper!
Janet H.	5	Very creamy, love the color!	This product is very affordable and it feels so smooth on the lips! I definitely will purchase more colors! Made of quality ingredients! Plus I am helping others with depression! It's a win - win!
Lisa S.	5	Very Happy	I have NEVER ordered any type of make up online before. Lipstick shades are hard to match when seen in the stores, much less on the computer screen! However, I am so happy with my lipstick from Color the World! Perfect color, texture, wear and look! I feel good supporting a company that gives back, and uses natural resources for its products. I will be a repeat customer as well as a walking commercial for Color the World!
Karyn A.	5	I love this lip stick.	I love this lip stick. It goes on nice and smooth. The fact that it is vegan really makes it so worth the extra $.  I gave one to my mom and she loves it as well.

Lynette P.	5	Perfect color	Lipstick stays on along time without staining lips. Perfect color for me.
Jan B.	5	Nice color, great texture!	Love this lipstick! Feels great going on with more moisture than other brands. Easy to layer with other colors of this brand to create different shades.

Kaye T.	5	Luscious Color!	I renamed this color to: "Pay Attention To Me!" It is so sweet and sexy, yet demure all at once. And even better is the incredible creamy base which transforms my dry, flaky & peeling lips to the softest and smoothest they've even been. I hope you can make this in a body cream - I'll buy it by the gallon!

Debra T.	5	All I Can Say Is: Wow!	I am so happy with these colors. And, true to the advertising, they do not feather. I have always been a "lipstick addict" but in my late 60's, I have found it doesn't always "wear well." Now I can happily return to daily wear! I have received numerous compliments on these colors - in a pinkish tone, not too light, but not too dark. They are great!
Emily H.	5	Best Lipstick I‚Äôve Found in Years	I cannot usually wear lipstick because it dries my lips out terribly. This is one of the first lipsticks that I have found in years that I can actually wear without my lips drying out terribly.   The color is long lasting and a great texture.

Christine B.	5	Love this lipstick. The ideal	Love this lipstick. The ideal that is in support of Alzheimer‚Äôs make it more special. When I put it on I think of my mother-in-law who suffered with Alzheimer‚Äôs and passed awAy in 2014. Nice shade. Good price. Great cause.

Gloria V.	5	Loving it	This is the first time I have ever ordered this lip stick but had been hearing so much about it and thought I would give it a try. NO REGRETS! It is really nice.
Cathleen G.	5	Can't get enough	Another excellent color from CTW. I love this lipstick so much. It stays on. It moisturizes, everyone loves the look. You can layer it from sheer to dark. Love the fact they give to good causes too.

Bev S.	5	Great lip stick	Wonderful lipstick so glad I tried it!
Barbara H.	5	Love the colors	Feels great. I love it
Debby T.	5	Simply Lovely	Finally, a lipstick that is naturally formulated with several muted colors that are not garish.
Julie B.	5	Very Nice Lipstick	I chose "Kisses" and it looks great with my olive skin. I have 1 suggestion -each time I open my tube it makes a suction sound unless I open it very slowly. I'm usually hurridly(is that a word) trying to be discreet when applying my lipstick in public. Usually at a restaurant or theater and the noise gives me away. Otherwise love the colors!
Angie T.	5	Wonderful Lipstick	I just received Huntress and Love it!! It goes on smooth and doesn't dry out or feather.....I'm really glad I ordered it!! It just makes your lips feel good!!
Pamela S.	5	I am so happy with these lipsticks!	I recently purchased the "premium lip treatment" as well as two other lipsticks, both of the same color, as I carry one in my purse and one in my cosmetic bag, and I am so happy with both. The lip treatment does help my dry lips when used at night and under lipstick. The lipstick itself looks great and most importantly for me, they do not bleed. I feel like my lips look better and I look a little younger without the issue of color bleed.   I just ordered two more lipsticks in another color, and I am telling people in my circle how great these products are!
Christina J.	5	Love this lipstick!	I love independent! But my favorite is dreamer .
Maria B.	5	Really nice lipstick	I purchased three colors and this is the one was my daughters choice. It looked great on her, she is blonde/blue eyes. I kept the glamberry for myself as i prefer a deeper color. One nice thing about these lipsticks is that they do not have any perfumey taste. I am not sure why these are recommended for over 40 They look good on every age.
Lisa P.	5	My favorite lipstick!	I have to admit I was a little skeptical about ordering a lipstick online. I figured if i didn‚Äôt like it at least the money would go to a good cause. The first thing I noticed after applying the lipstick was there was no scent or perfumes that I could taste. I liked the color Pretty N‚Äô Pink right away. I think it would be good for warm or cool skin tones. Then I noticed that this lipstick really stays on and does not feather as was advertised.  Then I let two of my friends know and they ordered it right away!  Thank you for supporting causes that I care about. Please don‚Äôt stop making these products!
Kathleen L.	5	Awesome	My second order of CTW lipsticks is so much fun! Unlike my first order, which was for one familiar color, the latter order is a set of 3 different shades, which I love but would never have tried had they not looked so tempting. My horizon has been broadened!
Diana M.	5	The greatest	I really loved this lipstick. Loved the color. I love the natural look. Goes on so smooth. And I'm not allergic to it. Others put blisters on my lips. Thank you and a awesome cause to support.
Sherry I.	5	Wonderful lipstick/great causes	Clean, creative, customized colors are perfect for those of a certain age and those of us who want to work with our individual color palette ( spring, summer, fall, winter) the strong women pack is perfect for a summer skin tone and color palette.
Stephanie L.	5	Love it!!!	I had been having trouble finding a great color lipstick that I didn‚Äôt have to apply every 20 minutes. I bought the Strong Woman pack. I love them! My favorite is the Empowered color. It is long lasting and beautiful!
Cristina D.	5	Feeling Fresh bundle	Colors work and stay put. Feels good on & not drying. Glad I‚Äôm helping a good cause at the same time. Will be ordering a true red soon.
Karen A.	5	My New "Fave" Lipstick	This is just the best lipstick I've ever tried. I'm 75, and been wearing lipstick since my teens, so I've tried just about every brand there is. ColortheWorld lipsticks just knocks them all out of the ballpark! So soft, creamy, and very light feeling on my lips. The ingredients are a big plus. I really like Empowerment and Dreamer.
Tami M.	5	The color matched perfect witch	The color matched perfect witch my skin tone and didn't feather as promised. I am very pleased with this product.
Jewel W.	5	Mature Woman	The lipstick I received from Color the World is creamy and smooth on my lips. As an older woman, I have lip lines but this lipstick does not fade into the lines. Thank you for a job well done in providing this to us and for the outreach it helps to support.
Mary W.	5	Best three that I have ordered.	I ordered Southern Red, Glamberry and Girls Night Out and I like these better than any that I have. As always, they stay put and don't bleed into the lines near my lips. But most of all, I like the Southern Red and the Glamberry because they are brighter and darker. The darker, brighter color is what I prefer and look best on me. I love these lipsticks and will continue to order more colors.
Linda K.	5	A really great lipstick.	I was a little concerned that it would be melted in the mailbox. It help up just fine at over a hundred degrees. I love the color. I will buy a couple more shades. I also will give this company 5 stars for their technology. Shipping and delivery notifications. Within hours of my order I had a tracking number. Thanks for the great job and great product.
Patricia R.	5	Jazzy Lip Colors	I am very pleased with my beautiful lip colors, especially Coco Razz. Goes on smoothly and is long wearing as they all are. I have gotten many compliments. I will be ordering again. Thanks a million!!!
Fran M.	5	Awesome lipstick!	As an older woman that has a few wrinkles around my lips, this lipstick stops the bleeding.
Kathie R.	5	Beautiful shades of lipstick. They	Beautiful shades of lipstick. They smooth on nicely.
Dina C.	5	Foxy is quite foxy	I was looking for a pinkish colored lipstick and this color did the trick. I have light, golden skin and this shade is perfect. It goes on smooth and has a lightweight feel. Feels like it has moisturizing properties since I did not have to apply chapstick or other lip moistening product before applying.
Kelly L.	5	Lucious lipsticks	I was hesitant to purchase more lipsticks to add to my "collection" but I thought I would give them a try. I love the colors and the lipsticks are wonderful. They stay on for a very long time without retouching. I don't need to use a lip pencil. They glide on but are not greasy nor do they smudge. I'm sold on these wonderful lipsticks.
Charlotte S.	5	Perfect colors	This is the greatest lipstick I have ever worn. The colors were made for ME!
Linda I.	5	Love these colors	Nice surprise to receive these very different lipsticks, beautiful colors, love the way it makes my (mature) lips look smooth. The lipstick cases are so pretty!
Arlene R.	5	Best lipstick Evet	Smooth, long lasting, beautiful colors! These lipsticks are an all around perfect lipstick, especially for people over 50!
Richard C.	5	Soft and durable lipsticks.	I am happy with the texture and colors in this bundle. The colors speak to the summer season and beyond. Keep up your good work,especially for all the special causes. I have my eyes on a few more colors as the fall nears. Thanks again to all the reviewers who made my shopping and choices easier. Deedee

Ann B.	5	Great products	I love the neutral bundle, especially "Huntress". These colors suit me to a T. but I really love the lip treatment "Mont To Be". I like the way it feels when I put it on, and then the mint kicks in. My lips sort of tingle when that happens. Feels like something is working just right.
Jo M.	5	Really Pleased!	I have not worn lipstick for many years, but I was initially intrigued by the non-feathering claims and the selection of flattering shades for a woman of my age, which is 66. Living in an exceptionally dry climate, my lips tend to dry out quickly. After only a few days of admittedly sporadic application, not only has there been no feathering, but my lips have remained softer than they ever did, even with prolonged use, of other well known lip balms. I will definitely purchase again.
Jean	5	New to Neutrals	I‚Äôve always been committed to cool colors but have gradually expanded my range. These colors were well described and I enjoy all of them...Kisses might be a little too light for me but perfect for my very fair daughter. Best of all is the texture, creaminess, and NO feathering. I was really surprised by this since cosmetic advertising is not always accurate. But this is beautiful, buildable color and I‚Äôll be adding to my collection. THANKS for making a great and reliable product. and reliable product.
Joan S.	5	This is a beautiful color	This is a beautiful color of the most delicate pink I‚Äôve ever seen! When you think of baby üë∂üèΩ pink this is it. Really is lovely!
Karen C.	5	Flirt	I love red and I love orange. Flirt blends the two in a sheer and creamy formula which does not allow one tone to dominate the other. Perfect for day or night.
Rosie N.	5	Neutrals Bundle	All of the shades in this bundle are great! Add the fact that these lipsticks are made with safe ingredients plus don't bleed and you have the perfect product.
Donna C.	5	Empowered!	Smooth application and feel on lips. Hard to actually realize color from picture and description. Next purchase the choice will be for a deeper color.
Marilou M.	5	55+ Lipstick Solver	Super colors to choose from and so creamy on your lips. This lipstick is easy to apply and most of all it Does Not Bleed into facial lines near the lip line. My problems are solved now that my lipstick stays where it is meant to be. Ordered 2more colors yesterday. Try it you will like it,
Donohue, G.	5	Love the feel!	I love the feel of the lipstick. So smooth and a great moisturizer for the lips. The shades I ordered were lighter than expected, so next time I'm going with boulder color so you can tell I'm wearing lipstick. But they work for a natural look.
Ziphora C.	5	Great color, texture, balance of	Great color, texture, balance of moisture, staying power

Barbara f.	5	Great!	I love the lipstick and would buy more colors but it is too difficult to decide on colors. I wish the name of the lipstick used would be listed below the models picture.
Rose M.	5	Perfection!	I ordered the Strong Women bundle first and absolutely loved them so I have ordered more. The colors are beautiful and creamy. They not only don't bleed, the stay on and last quite a while. I am over 60 and have been looking for lipstick like this for years. If you are on the fence about these lipsticks, get over it and buy some. And the Mint to Be lip balm is wonderful. They aren't just for older women. I think younger women will love them also.
Raziya F.	5	The Best Lipsticks	I love these lipsticks, not only does it give back, but it also provides shades of colors to suit everyone's face. This color worked on my skin tone. So if you are pale like me definitely give this one a buy! I am going to go purchase another one!

The fact that the lipstick helps those recover from brain injury and stroke is so important.

Karen K.	5	First try!	Huntress is the first lipstick I tried from Color the World, and I love it! Goes on smoothly, is creamy, and the color is very nice - like a darkish pink. And, it stays on. And, it helps DOGS?? Count me in!! I'm already back for more!
Gina C.	5	Finally!!! A product that really works and does what it says	Hi, I never write reviews and I don't shop on line much either but when this product appeared on line for this lipstick the pretty packaging caught my eye. I LOVE to wear lipstick and it's promise to be gentle on my skin but still have staying power really got my attention. However I was still VERY skeptical. So I started to read every review I could because I have been burned soooo many times in the past and have spent endless amounts of $ only to be disappointed yet again. This product delivered to me all that it promised, it's the real deal and I love it, it's my forever lipstick. I am going to buy the "Mint to be" and wish I would have ordered it with my first order. I am so impressed with this product. It's awesome and such a huge bonus that they give back to so many charities. Try it!!! I promise you won't be sorry. Finally my search for lipstick is over and it feels so good.
Laura T.	5	Natural beauty for a cause	I‚Äôve been looking for a lipstick that would look like what the celebrities wear and I think I‚Äôve found it- this color enhances my natural lip coloring and lasts a long time- goes on easily and stays smooth and soft! Buying more colors!
Sherry M.	5	Great lipstick!	I was very pleased with this lipstick. Most lipsticks dry my lips, but this one was moisturizing without being greasy. It had a lovely finish and felt very light. I will definitely order more colors!

Wink C.	5	Warrior	Love it!
Karen C.	5	Dreamer	I take caution with "purple" tones, as a too bright or chalky tone does me no good at all. I must say Dreamer got it just right!

These neutrals can mix with the darker/brighter lipstick shades to create new colors or be worn alone for an almost no lipstick look. Since I like a little bit more color to keep me from looking too washed out I have been using them over my brighter shades.

Lisa H.	5	Pretty colors!	This was my first Color The World purchase. I read the reviews about it being a lipstick for mature women, and that the colors don't bleed into the lines around your mouth. I agree! I like the way it goes on. It's not a thick sticky lipstick. It goes on like a regular moisturizing lipstick, but it definitely does not bleed into my lines. I'm 60, and that's been my biggest issue for about 10 years now. I really like the colors in this set, although I've only tried 2 out of the 3 colors. I only received my order 3 days ago. I will definitely buy from this company again.

Not so with Color Your World!, it‚Äôs creamy and stays on a long time. The moisturizer is great- no wax,makes your lips feel luxurious. I love the packaging and the fact I‚Äôm making a small contribution to many worthy causes. You have a customer for life.
Karen C.	5	24k	Purchasing the 24K lipstick is very much like finding a treasure. It is simply gorgeous whether worn alone, as a filler, or layered. I've even dotted and blended it just below my eyebrows and at the highest point of my cheekbones. Love this color!

Jill L.	5	Great Color	Similar to Mauve.

The colors are good (I bought 3 to try) and I love everyone I have bought and plan to buy several others, I really like Speechless and think it might end up being my favorite. I recommend this not only because it is a good product, but also because it goes to help a good cause. Give it a try and I think you will be as pleasantly surprised as I was.

Brad H.	5	great product!	I bought this lipstick because my Clinique lipstick in the same shade is running low. I was hesitant to try something new, but I really like the product and would recommend it.

Kerry W.	5	I love this lipstick	This lipstick doesn‚Äôt run, as promised. It is long-lasting and feels good on my lips. I took a risk with the color (Coral Reef) trusting the company would recognize that a mature woman would not want a psychedelic version. They produced a coral that is somewhat subdued. I will definitely make more purchases.
Billie F.	5	Color is warm and sweet as a kitten	I love the color. It has just the right amount of smoothness and not too shiny. I was happy to pick out a color that went to the kittens. I love cats. I would like to recommend to you to make a donation to the farm animal sanctuaries around the country. One of my favorites is Farm Animal Sanctuary in upper New York. Just YouTube "Farm Animal Sanctuary". These folks that do such wonderful work with rescuing and giving sanctuary to the farm animals that humans have chosen to be food source....I pray will get the best spot in Heaven...because they deserve it
Emily M.	5	great new lips	just received my three pack of lipsticks. I love the way they look, feel and keep my lips moisturized. They do not bleed so I'm not looking like a circus clown after applying it. Will be a customer for life. Love the colors too.
Sonceerahray M.	5	Real nice to use!	Great for bedtime or just don't want to put a color on. Feel very smooth on the lip. Doesn't run nor smear. Just a real nice product. Glad I bought this too.
Donna C.	5	Just Right	I have long been unhappy with the colors of lipstick available in stores. I am a business woman with lots of high level meetings. These shades are perfect. You definitely got it right.

Lee C.	5	Great lipstick for mature ladies!!	This lipstick is light, not dry, doesn‚Äôt feather into wrinkles. Nice matte, natural colors, love it!
Vicki g.	5	Nice taste	Good to use alone or over a lip pencil or other colors. The mint taste is just enough.
Debra O.	5	Independent	I love the color and how nicely it goes on your lips!!

Doreen P.	5	Love all three colors	I have fair complexion and all three colors look good on me.   They don't feather and LAST so I don't have to apply as often. Creamy just as advertised. So it's a win for me because I'm a lipstick lover!
Donna D.	5	‚ÄúBest ever‚Äù	Beautiful color, stays on and doesn‚Äôt feel dry after a few hours!!

Virginia S.	5	Delicious Colors!	Just in time for fall, this bundle is so rich in colors, it could be my new favorite!!! I will be ordering this again!!!
Sandra B.	5	Soooo pretty.	The best ever....where have you been!
Lynn L.	5	OMD - Part 2	Cashmere is my daytime color. It is the perfect shade, doesn't wander, and lasts all day. Flawless is - maybe - just a little too dark for me. I haven't worn lipstick for at least ten years and want to work up to the darker colors. The two I now wear have given me enormous confidence. BTW, the tubes are adorable, too!
Janet C.	5	Goodie	It does the job üòä

E. C.	5	Favorite	I love this color and the way it goes on and stays on--no feathering or bleeding. My friends are "hooked" too!
Renee R.	5	Nice lipstick	I have never been terribly good about using makeup, so I don‚Äôt really know what possessed me to order some of these now that I have entered into my 70s and have no actual hope to correct that habit. Still, order them I did, and I like them very much. All of the colors are great for those of us who are trying to age gracefully. While I can appreciate the subtle differences in the shades, I really can‚Äôt tell that much difference between them when on my lips. Still, I like the color(s) they give my lips and there is indeed no feathering or clumping. They go on very smoothly, and while I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre very much longer lasting than other lipsticks, they do last an average to better-than-average time on my lips. I recommend them to ladies who want to add that pretty finishing touch to their normal makeup routine.
Brenda T.	5	WOW!	Feels great on and I love the mint flavor. Very soothing.
Colleen C.	5	Love all!!!	Love all!!!

Cheryl H.	5	Love this lipstick	I‚Äôm so happy I found the Color the World site. I was a little apprehensive about ordering a lipstick sight unseen, but I‚Äôm glad I did. The texture provides a smooth, natural look and reduces the dryness of my lips. I am now wearing a pretty color every day.
Debra U.	5	I am fair complected and	I am fair complected and tend to have thin dry lips and have always found lipsticks to be a challenge for me in every way. I've tried for years to find the perfect lipstick and after trying your "Strong Woman Pack" and the "Mint to Be" clear, I can finally say I that my search is over. The Mint to Be is a perfect anytime moisturizer and a nice hint of mint in taste and smell. Not only does it keep my dry lips feeling soft it adds a perfect shine. The Strong Woman Pack had the absolute perfect balance of shades for my like and complexion as I tend to like a natural look with a hint of color. The shades are perfect and they also add moisture to my now "not so" dry lips. I absolutely love the fact that they all are vegan as well. Wonderful make and colors that last and I add a touch of the Mint to Be on top of my shade for extra shine at times. I am thrilled that I finally found lipsticks that for me, enhance, last and moisturize my lips and that I don't look like a painted clown when wearing them. The struggle is over and I do highly reccommend these and I will purchase more.

Linda S.	5	Vegan Lip Treatment	Love this lip treatment! The mint flavor is perfect and not makes your lips feel as smooth as silk!!
Sherry S.	5	Best Lipstick Ever!	Best Lipstick Ever! It stays on beautifully. I‚Äôve tried lots of lipstick shades and Girls Night Out (GNO) goes with everything! Not too dark or too light. And part of proceeds go to breast cancer research.

Lee M.	5	Pretty pretty pretty	Just the shade I was looking for.
Sonceerahray M.	5	Love them!	So far I love them. I noticed that that these lipsticks stay put and last longer than the commercial name brands. Those really do bleed, and really show my lines that are from aging. Its so hard to find anything that I like, probably because I am very picky. Now if you can come up with a mascara that 1. has a reasonable sized brush, like 5 mm's round. 2. doesn't clump!...hate that. 3. staying power...doesn't sweat off! I would buy that as well.  I love the colors of the lipsticks and have ordered several more. I also am lucky in the fact I can wear either color! Keep up the good work.  In addition, big time kudos for donating a percentage to many good causes!
Chris C.	5	Very nice.	Moisturizing. Comfortable. Slight mint smell. Super cute packaging! Will purchase again!
Melissa D.	5	Confident	Love the smoothness and lasting power! The shad was a bit harsh on me, but I layered another shade over it and it was great.
Melissa J.	5	Super Good To Lips	Product delivered as promised. Smooth, conditionong and lasting. Great tube design too! Was trying for an almost 60's mod light neutral but color was a little darker than I wanted. Didn't see anything lighter.

Josephine Z.	5	love my new lipsticks	The lip color is light, smooth when applied, and doesn't feel dry. I love the packaging..It feels very nice on my lips..The colors are also beautiful!
Susan M.	5	Finishing touch	Goes on smooth, gives a little color to your lips so you don‚Äôt look ‚Äúwashed out.‚Äù
Cynthia H.	5	Great color	Perfect color for me-smooth and creamy with just enough matte to last long
Lynn L.	5	OMD!	I bought three colors because part of the money goes to good causes. I expected to try one, find it was like all the others, and toss them away. Oh My Dog these lipsticks are miracles! I gave up wearing lipstick because it was just too much of hassle and because I was constantly on patrol for color wandering into the lines. The colors I chose are subtle enough for an older woman, but define my lips, they really last all day without feeling tacky, and make me smile at myself in the mirror. I have light skin, gray hair and blue eyes. The Cashmere is perfect for day and Surfberry is awesome for evenings.

Linda S.	5	Very creamy and doesn‚Äôt dry	Very creamy and doesn‚Äôt dry my lips out like so many other lipsticks do
Sherry T.	5	Wishes Do Come True	I love how creamy these lipsticks go on, and stay on. They feel good on my lips, not greasy and not drying. I ordered the 3 Wishes Bundle and every color is not only wearable but also a perfect complement to my skin color; I am a medium brown Black woman. This is my new go-to for lipsticks company.
Arthur D.	5	Rose	The color is a beautiful warm light pink. I am a redhead and have those "high color" pink cheeks and it is a perfect color for a summer day.  I also use it as a glaze over deeper colors in the evening. Actually, when the Rose arrived, it was broken at the base, but I contacted CTW and within a couple days it was replaced with apologies. The other 4 colors I ordered had no problems and this replacement doesn't it.  The CTW lipsticks last better than others in my collection and don't cake on my lips.  I have already shared CTW with several friends and do not hesitate to recommend the company and the lipstick. Helping to support the charities is icing on the cake!
Terri C.	5	Mint to Be	I love it. It keeps my dry lips moist  Terri L Cronin

Jane S.	5	Very nice, smooth. Fast delivery.	Very nice, smooth. Fast delivery. The color was a little lighter than I thought so I need to order a little darker shade.
Laura R.	5	Smooth as silk	I love these lipsticks, truly. The colors are great and allow me to be a bit more daring at times, and back to subtle in the next hour. The colors mix easily, if I use 2 at once to create my own personal shade. Not to mention they glide on so easily and smooth. My lips feel good and I appreciate that they don't feather, smear or wear unevenly leaving me with what appears to be more of a lip liner look. I find I reach for them in my bag, or off my counter often. Great find. Grab your shades and get going
Diane S.	5	Like it	Like it
Donna F.	5	Love it	I was first surprised that the tube cover is cardboard, but I love the low environmental impact of that. I love the shade, it's perfect for my coloring, thanks for the handy guide to selecting a color! The lip color also feels rich and moisturizing, not at all waxy as I feared. I appreciate that you"give back" to charitable organizations, however I might like to be given the choice between the missions you support. Keep up the good works!

Roxanne F.	5	Surprised	To my surprise your lipstick is everything you said it would be. I love it, it‚Äôs the best lipstick I‚Äôve used in a long time. I will continue to get my lipstick from you. Thanks

GINNY	5	Creamy, Pretty Goddess	First time buyer and never bought lipstick online especially without first seeing or testing it. I love the color, goes on smoothly and stays on and will definitely buy again.
Diane J.	5	Wonderful Lipsticks	Like many of the previous reviewers, I had stopped using lipstick some years ago. This is mainly due to feathering that I experienced even with expensive department store lipsticks, and that's even with using a lipliner. I saw an ad for Color the .World lipsticks and checked out the website. While I usually think that if something is too good to be true, it is too good to be true. However, these products definitely live up to their promises (great on 'aging' lips, no feathering, a container that can be recycled and more). The three colors I purchased are lovely and I will definitely be a return customer. Thanks!
lamccolm	5	Fall Bundle	After my initial purchase of one of your lipsticks I recently purchased the Fall Bundle. Your lipsticks are so moisturizing and I'm so happy to finally find one that is. One of the items in the bundle is too light for me. I also love the lip treatment. Thank you.
Lorraine A.	5	These are now my favorite lipsticks ever	This is a very pretty, light color, that brightens up my face, without being obnoxious. It surprised me how it lasts amazingly well. It pretty much stays on even after lunch. I just give it a little touch up. I always wear lip liner, and the color still doesn‚Äôt wander where it doesn‚Äôt belong, no feathering, like all of my other brands of lipstick. It also feels very smooth and moisturizing, doesn‚Äôt dry my lips or feel sticky.
Lisa L.	5	This lipstick is awesome	The color is beautiful, and how great is it that you are not only getting an awesome product but also helping great causes. A company that offers top quality lipstick and gives back! Colors go on creamy and there is no feathering. Leaves your lips feeling moisturized and looking great
Robin G.	5	Very nice and refreshing	Love my Huntress color. The texture is smooth and refreshing on my lips and the color lasts for hours. Shipped and arrived much faster than I expected. I will order additional colors.
Debra M.	5	Absolutely LOVE the 3 I	Absolutely LOVE the 3 I just received. The mint lip treatment is awesome.... Can even wear under the lipstick to make it even more creamy
Gayla P.	5	Surfberry Sensational!!	Slightly between a pink and peachy color; perfect for summer days; a happy color!
Cheryl G.	5	BEST LIPSTICK EVER	Love the color. I was worried because it is a shimmery one, but no worries, it is not a gaudy shimmer. Goes on smoothly, like lip balm, wears off evenly (doesn't leave that line at the edge of the lips), and doesn't bleed. I'll never have to look for another brand of lipstick.
Terry E.	5	Love this lipstick. I was	Love this lipstick. I was wondering if it comes in a lighter color. Terry
Diane L.	5	Wonderful lipstick!	Love your lipsticks, stays on better, love the way it feels. It is not greasy but makes your lips feel soft and best part it does not bleed. Thanks
Jean W.	5	"Kisses" is a perfect color	"Kisses" is a perfect color ... subtle yet defines my lips nicely. it is smooth and silky. i am very pleased i found COLOR THE WORLD and truly support everything they stand for.

Tracey F.	5	Love it!	The lipstick goes on smooth and stays for much longer than I expected. I am very happy and will be ordering more.
Laura M.	5	Great	Really enjoy the lipstick and especially the colors. At my age I don't need "glossy red" lipsticks. Also nice to be support an organization with my purchase.
Cheryl C.	5	Beautiful bright summer color!	Coral Reef is a bright coral perfect to match the summer corals in clothes. It's a lighter color than Sunset with a tad bit more orange tone but not too much. I'm a dark blonde with fair/medium warm skin tone and Sunset is my favorite color. Coral Reef definitely comes in a close second though.
Eleanor G.	5	PrettyN'Pink	Love this color of pink, plus it goes on lips so easily and smoothly. Has just the slightest little shine to add the perfect touch.  It is not gaudy either--just perfect and "happy" color.
Dottie S.	5	Creamy, soft lips	I'm a (very) senior citizen. This is the first lipstick I've found that is creamy, non-staining, and doesn't dry out my lips. I've ordered twice.
Natalie P.	5	Love this lipstick! Biodegradable cardboard tube is so cute.	Wildflower is a lovely peachy-pink color. Very flattering. Feels light going on & I like the combination of shine with no gloss. More shine than matte but not as dry as a matte finish would be. The clear Mint to Be is a great finish or I can use it as lip balm. Thank you!
Teresa S.	5	Awesome	Love this lipstick, does what it promised, no bleeding. , feathering, fading , lasts for ages ,
Cheryl C.	5	Perfect mauve color	Pretty N' Pink reminds me of the color of lipstick I wore in the 80's. A perfect in between mauve/rose with a bit of shimmer. Not too light and not too dark. Love it!
Karen W.	5	I like the feel and	I like the feel and texture of the lipstick. They glide on very well but I swear I eat my lipsticks off. The color is great and they do not leave lines just like you stated. I need a varnish to keep the color on. I do like the product and will buy more colors as they do feel great and don‚Äôt have a perfume odor.

Cheryl K.	5	Staying Power	I‚Äôve been using this for one week and it has been a winner. I may lighten my shade a slight bit, however this lipstick stays for hours! I helped my son and family move into a new home and was pleasantly pleased when, after 6-8 hours of working very hard in desert climate, my lipstick was still strong as I peeked in my car mirror on my way home! Definitely going back for seconds.

This lipstick is a lovely shade, has a great case- made of some sort of recyclable paper (I think) and lasts without bleeding. Great product.

Mary B.	5	Truly love it!	Love "Mint to Be" I wear it everyday alone or under lipstick. It feels fantastic. I'll never use Chapstick again
Melissa	5	Independent not for me, but Dreamer ... YES!!	This color is too light for me, but luckily I found Dreamer, so I could always use both at the same time. Dreamer is the one I prefer. It is almost identical to the Mulberry 701 by L'Oreal which they discontinued years ago. I came upon this site and checked to see if they had anything close. Just decided to wing it and purchase Dreamer since it has a medium shade of purple in it. Bingo! It's perfect and now I not only have my shade available to me, but it's Vegan! Also, I must add customer service here is phenomenal. I got my first lipstick and tried it on immediately. Got the second one, did the same, but it smashed. I had no idea we had to wait 4 hours due to hot weather. Never saw the tiny tiny lettering on the receipt until I looked at it for a phone number. Then I saw the information. Needless to say I wrote CS immediately and got a fairly quick response. They were happy to replace it for free and shipped it immediately. Received the new tube within a couple days. Trust me, I will never smash another one again. lol Definitely try these lipsticks!
Barbara T.	5	Huntress	Love, love, love the color! How to select the right shade was a big help. The lipstick is perfect for my skin tone. I‚Äôm ordering another one!
K.C.	5	Tickled Pink	LOVE the color!!
Roeann	5	The Best Lipstick	This is the best lipstick I have ever used. Better than the most expensive brands I've purchased. Wonderful moisturizing and stays in place. Last a long time once applied. I highly recommend this product. This color is also beautiful.
Melissa	5	Lovely shade!	I got this hoping it would match up to my L'Oreal 701 Mulberry and luckily it did. I've been wearing 701 for at least 20 years and they decided to discontinue it. It is almost exact to what I wanted, so I'm now a customer for life. Please don't ever get rid of Dreamer. lol
Dee D.	5	My First of Many	The color is vibrant and luscious. It makes my lips feel soft and smooth and let's face it, sexy too! Color stays on for the long run. I'm going to try more shades soon!
Shanley	5	I Love These Lipsticks!	I have purchased Huntress, Rose, and Wildberry and love them all. I have found them to be slightly lighter than pictured, which works great for my coloring.  I will continue to buy more more as I believe that that are good quality and very reasonably priced.
ChristyL	5	Best ever!	I just received my flawless shade of lipstick. This is by far the best shade and best lipstick I have bought in a very long time. It goes on very creamy and stays that way and the shade is beautiful. I hate it when I buy lipsticks that end up on my teeth in the first few minutes. This does not happen with this brand. I am going to be ordering several more colors. Definitely worth the price and then some!! And the fact that this company gives back seals the deal for me.
Sandy	5	Great Color	Love the color as well as the smooth, creamy feel. The color is universal and goes with everything. This is my new "go to" lipstick.
Blanca R.	5	So nice	I saw this in an ad i was well let me give them a try being 42 sometimes the lipstick out there are to for teens i am glad i did i like the colors they do stay on very well i also loved that by buy this we get to help out i did place other order great lipstickes
Victoria B.	5	Wonderful	I can't say enough about this lipstick. It goes on smooth, lasts better than anything I've tried including those sticky stain ones, and it feels nice.
Debra O.	5	Perfect shade for me!	After much searching, I've finally found a great shade of lipstick for me! This is one that doesn't turn "too orange!" or "too pink!" like most lipsticks do on me. I have sort of deep-colored lips for a caucasian, so it's really hard to find a good color. I bought Revolutionary, Cocorazz, and Irresistible together, and I love all three. Thanks, Color the World!
Linda N.	5	Warm tone color	I love the new WARM tone color I chose this time. I found a section on your website that listed cool tones and warm tones and would love a WARM tone bundle next time. So moist and creamy - love your lipsticks!
Judy N.	5	Color perfect	Great color, stays on my lips..although i do eat it off on occasion..the color is good and it does not bleed into those annoying little lines around my mouth....I'm almost 70 and this color just gives a little light to my face...great lipstick!
Diane	5	Very creamy for my super senior lips!	I ordered this 3-pack and am very pleased with the product. Two out of the three colors are good for me. The lighter one I'll pass on to a younger friend. I especially like the red color - not too dark!
Cheryl S.	5	excellent product	I took a chance on the bundle and am happy to say that they all are very nice in terms of color for me. I use Kisses - the lightest - in the center of my lower lip. Great staying power and feel. Highly recommend.
Donna C.	5	Love these	Very subtle colors; smooth and creamy
Karen S.	5	Great Coral Pink Color	This coral shade will go with coral or pink colors. A great color for summer.

Karen S.	5	Great color, great coverage	This lipstick is a beautiful shade of pink with just a hint of purple. Best of all, it performs like the other Color the World lipsticks‚Äîno bleeding, no feathering. I‚Äôm 74 years old. Since I found CTW, I won‚Äôt wear anything else..

Carolyn M.	5	Beautiful colors, sm-o-o-th lips. I	Beautiful colors, sm-o-o-th lips. I have several colors with Wildflower, and they give me a wardrobe of colors, as you can layer them for great new looks. The lip conditioner (no color) is the best thing I have found to smooth my lips at night (after I exfoliate them with a soft toothbrush)...I make sure to use the conditioner on those mean little vertical lip lines, and they are getting less visible all the time! YAY!
Gloria F.	5	Vibrant color, smooth lipstick	I'm enjoying the new lipstick very much. It glides on smoothly and definitely does not feather, as the ads say. I ordered several colors, and like them all. Would definitely recommend these lipsticks! Thank you.

Joan M.	5	Stron Women Pack	I love the creaminess and texture of your lipsticks. I really only like one of the colors of those three on me - but that's not really a negative comment - just one of those things. Some colors that you think will look good aren't as becoming as you think on your particular complexion. I ordered another rose shade recently and I love it! Your lipsticks are very good.

Margaret F.	5	This is the color for me!	It's hard to tell from a picture, but I tried my first lipstick- too light. I ordered another one that I thought would be too dark and it's perfect! I think this is the best lipstick I have ever had!!

Lianne S.	5	VERY PLEASED	I recently purchased 4 different shades from the Color the World Lipsticks and I love them all. The shades are beautiful and go well with my skin tone (as advised). They go on smoothly and the color lasts a long time. I also love the Mint to Be (colorless) because my lips are dry and get chapped easily and it works better than any chap stick that I've ever tried !!
Bryna R.	5	The best	It works!
Cynthia S.	5	Glam Pack	Loved my new Glam Pack! The colors are vibrant and they glide on like silk. Best lipstick I've ever found that doesn't feather and is so creamy and moist. Cindy Stone
Wendy S.	5	Love love love it	True to the claim, it does not feather or show lip lines. Being over 50 and a former smoker, the feathering/bleeding is a concern and no more when I use my Flawless. I am so impressed with this lipstick. From the pretty packaging to the terrific color and non drying formula I cannot wait to try some more colors. The fact that the company gives back and supports numerous causes is the icing on the cake. SO happy I found you.
Sharon R.	5	This is a new product for me.	I love this color and moisture...I have ordered 3 more colors!
Judith P.	5	Creamy and pretty	Love the texture of this lipstick and the color is a perfect neutral. The case is so cute and fun to carry with me.

Elizabeth S.	5	Very satified!	I hardly ever wear lipstick because I never like the shade it becomes on me. I like soft mauve or pink colors. I also bite and pick my lips so lipstick doesn't stay on very long. This lipstick feels very soft and creamy on my lips and I love the color (Flawless) for everyday use, which I'm beginning to do. I would like to have a shade darker for evening wear. So I'll probably order the next shade in the trio.
Sandy M.	5	Cute container	I love the one I got...Will get a darker shade next time

I love that I was able to buy all 3 lipsticks in a bundle even though there was one color in particular i‚Äôve been looking for and now have 2 more lipsticks that also look fantastic! The lipstick itself goes on smoothly with wonderful color coverage and stays put. At the end of the day my lips stay hydrated. I even love the packaging! Since wearing 2 of 3 colors, I‚Äôve gotten compliments on both from folks that don‚Äôt normally notice that I‚Äôm wearing lipstick!! Lastly I‚Äôm gratified to know a portion of the sale of these lipsticks goes towards a good cause - it‚Äôs a win/win anyway you look at it!!

Jane L.	5	Lovely bright shade of lipstick	I ordered Speechless because I was looking for a brighter color than my 2 previously-purchased shades. I really like it and, as promised, it goes on smoothly and does not run into the fine lines around my lips. I am 71 and very pleased with this product.

Eleanor R.	5	the feeling fresh bundle of lipsticks	Most lipsticks get dry and do not remain colorfull for very long. My experience with the bundle I got is that there are no bleeding lines and the lipstick color stays fresh looking for a long time. I will be buying more in more colors. It's a good product and a good investment.
Derra H.	5	Sunset	I absolutely love my first purchase of ‚ÄúSunset‚Äù. I also bought ‚ÄúMint to Be‚Äù and enjoy wearing it underneath as a base coat. I also love the refreshing tingle of the mint. I have been recommending this company to all of my friends and even bought the 24K as a birthday gift for one of them. She loves the color and creamy texture. And of course, I love that great charities are supported. For sure, I‚Äôll be buying more colors soon!
Marcia M.	5	Beautiful Color!	This lipstick is wonderful! I‚Äôve purchased my ‚Äúeveryday‚Äù lipstick from Color The World more than once because it applies so easily, doesn‚Äôt dry my lips, and makes my aging lips look smooth.

Leonie T.	5	Love it!!	The most natural shade ever, normally so hard to find. Very grateful to have found this company. Highly recommend.
Alba H.	5	Love it!	This is the second time I've ordered Girls Night Out! I think I have about 8 or 9 tubes of Color The World lipsticks. It's all I wear! Colors are vibrant, long lasting, & full of moisture! And no feathering! Plus the donations to good causes is a bonus!
Karola T.	5	My World has been Colored!	I was intrigued by the ad and liked the colrs available. It was about 98 degrees here when the package arrived and I was concerned because most lipsticks would have melted. I opened it, and it was in perfect shape. The accompanying instruction said to let it sit for a while. The case is lovely printed cardboard, not plastic. The lipstick had not melted, it is a wonderful color and feels really good on my lips!This is a real win for me and I give it my highest recommendation.
Norma S.	5	Perfect Color!	I absolutely love your lipstick! I have four, which definitely cover my skin tone. But best of all, they DON'T MAKE MY LIPS PEEL!!!!!!!
Pati M.	5	Great color and product! Can't	Great color and product! Can't wait to try another one!

It's such a pretty color and compliments any outfit or occasion and looks great on me. I have light brown hair and blue eyes, light complexion. It goes on soft and lasts much longer than any other lipstick brand I've ever used!
Kathy B.	5	Magnificent!	Beautiful, soft, and comfortable lipstick. I love it!
Amy F.	5	Kisses-‚ÄòHomes for our Troops‚Äô	This is my second order, and always pleased with the products. So much so I bought for my daughters.

Lily L.	5	excellent moisturizer	The color is not wild and it keeps my lips moist.
Gael D.	5	Surfberry	My sister, via my other sister, said she wanted a lipstick for her birthday. As to color, she indicated the word "berry" should be in the name. (Not as easy as it sounds). I'd discovered World of Color and Surfberry turned out to be a perfect gift for her. Throw in the safe water action, and we had a meeting of the hearts.
Janet T.	5	Surfberry - Fresh Pink	These lipsticks are a new experience for me. I like that they benefit good causes which was my initial reason for purchasing. Surfberry, while not fuchsia pink, is a nice clean pink color more like a light watermelon color. It can be layered and I use it with a liner for more definition and it stays on for a long time. Great color! Cute case!
Gale R.	5	Gorgeous lipsticks	I love these lipsticks! The colors are subtle yet it‚Äôs apparent I‚Äôm wearing lipstick, because my own lips have lost almost all the color I was born with. They are creamy and last several hours. Absolutely no feathering.
Kathy B.	5	A gift.	Made a great gift for my mom. The color isn't as bright as it seems in the pic but it's very pretty.
Rhonda K.	5	Perfect everyday color	I will never be without this color! It is the perfect everyday pinky nude. Plus it feels great on your lips.. Obsessed

Sherry S.	5	Beautiful color!	I just received my first lipstick from Color the World, and I have to say that I was really impressed with how nice it is. The color is beautiful, and the lipstick is very smooth and creamy, and it's all natural ingredients. It's in a lovely flowery sturdy cardboard type tube. I love that each color of lipstick helps to support a different cause; Empowered, the one I bought helps fund people who deal with anxiety and depression.
Valori L.	5	Liked it. More like a	Liked it. More like a moisturizer lip stain
Peggy A.	5	I have used many different	I have used many different kinds of li gloss before, but this one, ‚Äú Mint to Be ‚Äú is wonderful!! It stays on and moisturizes my lips like no other gloss has ever done! It gives the lips a refreshing feeling!! I wish I had tried this many years ago! I am 85!

Patricia G.	5	Color me perfect	Love love love this color it goes on so smooth and soft
Carol A.	5	Worth Re-Ordering!	This is my second order of this product. I use it every time I wear lipstick as a "first coat" before adding color. It glides on smoothly and helps my lips stay hydrated. I reach for this, rather than other clear products I have because it is so easy to apply!
Doris K.	5	Huntress is fabulous	My first time buying and quickly ordered a second color. Goes on smooth and stays on. Never feels dry at all. Price is great!
Kathleen C.	5	Perfect every day lip color	This is a great natural color that doesn‚Äôt feather!

Christy W.	5	Huge Fan	I love this product so much I keep buying additional shades to play with. Changing colors for mood and event.
Donna E.	5	So creamy!	What a wonderful product for a mature woman like myself. The lipstick first of all feels good due to the creaminess content. I chose the color "Flawless". It is perfect for everyday use and I intend to try one of the pinker colors next. It truly doesn't feather and bleed. I will admit that I use a lipstick primer first then use the lipstick and have found that the color lasts a good six hours before I need to reapply. I like spending my money on products that do good where good is needed rather than in the pockets of company CEO's! Thank you, Donna Elton
Patrice P.	5	Perfect Lipsticks!	This 3 pack is perfect...love the colors... go on smoothly and there is no feathering or bleeding. Love this product!

All the lipsticks that I ordered feel amazing on my lips. Very silky! I've never had a lipstick that felt this good for hours. Other brands were wiped off as soon as I came home, this I keep on all day, even when I'm not going out. Please make a lip liner.

Chloe R.	5	Yowsa Flirt	I love this color. I have four CtW lipsticks and I love them all but Flirt is really perfect for fair-skinned women. More than that I truly love the eco-friendly tubes, the good causes they support and this brilliant concept in lipstick. As much as my heart breaks to retire other lipsticks - shades I have loved, all things, everything considered -Color the World is a product for this very time and place for women of a certain age and a great tradition to start with our daughters and nieces and even nephews. It is ageless and relevant! Love it. And Flirt - YOWSA!

Victoria M.	5	Even better than expected!	This set of lipsticks was my first Color the World purchase. I am over 60 and was not sure the lipsticks would live up to the description on the web site. But they really did! The lipsticks do no feather or accentuate fine lines, and they are extremely flattering. I will definitely purchase again -:)

Elizabeth E.	5	Perfect color	This turns out to be the ‚Äòperfect‚Äô subtle color for my lips - it is just enough to brighten my eyes!

Christine G.	5	Color pretty and a bit	Color pretty and a bit lighter on my lips than it appears, this is a good thing. I would consider Confident to be a "cool tone" color. Also bought Sunset and Pretty N'Pink which I like very much. Over due throwing out the old lipstick tubes.

Judith K.	5	Lipstick	I have been looking for a lippy that reminded me of lipstick from the 1970, 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs. And your lipstick is the closest I have found. It lasts nicely and feels nice on the lips. I really love the rose gold. It reminds me of a lipstick I wore years ago.
Anne G.	5	Beautiful shades	Very moisturizing, long lasting color.
Jeannie T.	5	The colours were even nicer	The colours were even nicer than they were on screen. I was originally going to give two out of the bundle to my daughter-in-law, but when I saw the colours, decided to keep them all. Ordered an entire 2nd set for her.    My only complaint is that I was not notified when they shipped. The original confirmation said that I would receive notification. I had to send a message and ask if they had been shipped.  Very pleased with CTW otherwise.

Diane K.	5	Worth Every Penny	The first I have found that doesn‚Äôt cake or bleed!
Nancy B.	5	Yummy color!	The color seems more brown than mauve ~ I was definitely expecting more mauve tones, but I still love it. The shimmer is very muted, just perfect for me. It's in my purse as my current go-to color. At 66, with dark hair and, so far, very little grey in it, I definitely need more color on my lips! I like this a lot!
Benita M.	5	Will wear	Goes on lighter than what I thought, but like the color

Paige W.	5	It's A Miracle!	I have been searching for a lip color that stays, is a pleasant color, doesn't dehydrate my lips, and doesn't bleed. This is it! It meets all my criteria, and as a bonus, the company supports so many great causes. I love the eco-friendly packaging too. I have a drawer of about 20 different lip products that didn't really give me what I was looking for. I can toss those now. Color the World, you have a customer for life!

Elaine G.	5	Nice lipstick	I have about 5 different lipsticks from Color the World. I am still trying to find my perfect shade. I believe they go on about a shade lighter than pictured, but that could just be me. It won‚Äôt stop me from buying the lipstick....
Antoinette A.	5	WOW	I can honestly say that I had a wow moment when I applied my new lipstick. It was amazing...the texture was pure silk. I hate lipsticks that feel greasy & slimy. This was just the opposite. I have a problem with drying effect of matte lipstick.... this feels wonderful, even after wearing it for 8 hours, I can still feel the moisture on my lips (not grease). I'm 70 years old with some small wrinkles above my lip. This lipstick never "bled" into them. Now all I ask of Color the World.....PLEASE make a lipliner of the same quality.

Your formula makes my lips look like they are YOUNG again! This color is bit too pink for me but the way it sits is unreal. My lips are smooth and youthful! I need more purple tones for my lip color though. Amy suggestions on which to get? I LOVE your product and only want to use yours but need darker more purple.
